They’re useful while still managing to look cute!” After turning to the crafting mecca of the Internet world, a.k.a. Pinterest, here are some totally doable and creative ideas to whip your craft room into shape!</p> <p><strong>1.</strong> Make use of vertical space with a peg board, like this project from <strong> </strong><a href="http://www.craft-o-maniac.com/2014/07/craft-room-wall-whites-brights.html" target="_blank">Craft-O-Maniac</a>…</p> <p><a data-pin-do="embedPin" href="http://www.pinterest.com/pin/542683823821963340/"></a></p> <p><strong>2.</strong> …Or install a few towel bars and use hooks to hang tools and containers for your supplies, like this tidy corner from <a href="http://www.aprudentlife.com/2014/craft-room-guest-room-combo-reveal/" target="_blank">A Prudent Life</a>.</p> <p><a data-pin-do="embedPin" href="http://www.pinterest.com/pin/285556432597804438/"></a></p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Maximize shelving space in your closets with a container system. This idea from <a href="http://findinghomeonline.com/sorting-organzing-craft-supplies/" target="_blank">Finding Home</a> is especially organized with its clearly-labeled boxes that all stack neatly together.</p> <p><a data-pin-do="embedPin" href="http://www.pinterest.com/pin/75716837459954362/"></a></p> <p><strong>4.</strong> For those of you like me with piles upon piles of fabric scraps, this vertical folding idea from <a href="http://myfabricobsession.blogspot.com/2011/04/wip-wednesday-24.html" target="_blank">My Fabric Obsession </a>will keep them neat and filed away for easy access.</p> <p><a data-pin-do="embedPin" href="http://www.pinterest.com/pin/156570524518635329/"></a></p> <p><strong>5.</strong> For all you knitting machines, repurpose a wine rack like <a href="http://www.repeatcrafterme.com/2014/02/yarn-storage-system.html" target="_blank">Repeat Crafter Me</a> to put your collection of yarn on display.</p> <p><a data-pin-do="embedPin" href="http://www.pinterest.com/pin/449515606531688403/"></a></p> <p><strong>6.</strong> Keep ribbon from tangling by storing them in an upcycled oatmeal can. This easy tutorial from <a href="http://www.curbly.com/users/modhomeecteacher/posts/5735-upcycle-turn-an-oatmeal-box-into-a-pretty-ribbon-holder" target="_blank">Curbly</a> shows you how you can customize the look, too!</p> <p><a data-pin-do="embedPin" href="http://www.pinterest.com/pin/153966880986424416/"></a></p> <p><strong>7.</strong> You can also keep your ribbon spools on tiered hangers to stow them away in the closet. This idea from <a href="http://queenbumblebee.hubpages.com/hub/How-to-clean-and-organize-your-craft-room-Ideas-for-saving-space-and-time" target="_blank">Queen Bumblebee</a> also makes use of closet space with hanging organizers to keep small items together.</p> <p><a data-pin-do="embedPin" href="http://www.pinterest.com/pin/477100154247420449/"></a></p> <p><strong>8.</strong> Have a mish-mash of small supplies that need organizing? Take this idea from <a href="http://rockwellali.blogspot.com/2011/02/few-things-ive-been-working-on.html" target="_blank">Away We Go</a> and use a spice rack to wrangle them together…</p> <p><a data-pin-do="embedPin" href="http://www.pinterest.com/pin/241787073716346524/"></a></p> <p><strong>9.</strong> …Or repurpose an old cupcake display to keep all your miscellaneous supplies on hand. This example from <a href="http://michellewooderson.blogspot.com/2012/01/project-life-organizationmy-work-space.html" target="_blank">Michelle Wooderson </a>uses an old tier stand from <a href="http://www.potterybarn.com/" target="_blank">Pottery Barn</a>.</p> <p><a data-pin-do="embedPin" href="http://www.pinterest.com/pin/215046950931865748/"></a></p> <p><strong>10.</strong> To keep even smaller supplies from getting lost in the mix, sort them into pill dispensers like this one from <a href="http://www.bhg.com/decorating/storage/craft-room/quick-clever-ideas-for-organizing-crafts-supplies/#page=12" target="_blank">Better Homes and Gardens</a>.</p> <p><a data-pin-do="embedPin" href="http://www.pinterest.com/pin/232287293252492753/"></a></p> <p><strong>11.</strong> If you’re feeling particularly ambitious, try out this amazing project from <a href="http://www.designimprovised.com/2013/09/craft-room-ideas.html" target="_blank">Design Improvised</a> and turn an old armoire into a one-stop crafting station.</p> <p><a data-pin-do="embedPin" href="http://www.pinterest.com/pin/56787645274784509/"></a></p> <p><strong>12.</strong> And if all else fails, remember that mason jars can help organize just about anything.</p> <p><a data-pin-do="embedPin" href="http://www.pinterest.com/pin/98657048061108459/"></a></p> <p><em>(h/t <a href="http://www.hometalk.com/1461341/mason-jar-craft-storage" target="_blank">Hometalk</a>)</em></p> <p><a data-pin-do="embedPin" href="http://www.pinterest.com/pin/128211920616344297/"></a></p> <p><i>(h/t <a href="http://www.livelovediy.com/2013/06/the-wednesday-6-high-style-design-flea.html" target="_blank">Live Love DIY</a>)</i></p> <p><a data-pin-do="embedPin" href="http://www.pinterest.com/pin/80079699597693284/"></a></p> <p><em>(h/t <a href="http://www.poofycheeks.com/2012/08/mason-jar-storage-shelf-tutorial.html" target="_blank">Poofy Cheeks</a>)</em></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>You Might Also Like:</strong><br /> <a href="http://realitycheckers.allyou.com//?xid=allyou" target="_blank"><strong>Become A Reality Checker for Exclusive Freebies, Tips and More »</strong></a><br /> <a href="http://www.allyou.com/budget-home/organizing-cleaning/desk-organization-tips" target="_blank"><strong>How to Banish Desk Clutter, Once and For All! »</strong></a><br /> <a href="http://www.allyou.com/budget-home/organizing-cleaning/command-center" target="_blank"><strong>Build Your Own Kitchen Command Center on a Budget »</strong></a></p>]]></description><author>Jennifer Liu, Digital Editorial Assistant</author><category>Lifestyle &amp; Food</category><source>All You</source><channel>Rminutemag1.2295</channel><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Time Inc.

But it appears the French turn up their noses at such tomfoolery. A judge from the French city of Valenciennes recently ruled that a baby girl born in September would have to be renamed, stating that naming the child ‘ <a href="http://www.allyou.com/food/recipes/nutella-recipes">Nutella</a>’ was against her interest.</p> <p>“The name ‘Nutella’ given to the child is the trade name of a spread,” the court’s decision read, according to a <a href="http://time.com/3681714/nutellla-child/" target="_blank">translation by <em>Time</em></a>. “And it is contrary to the child’s interest to be wearing a name like that can only lead to teasing or disparaging thoughts.”</p> <p>The judge legally renamed the now four-month-old baby ‘Ella’ after the offending parents failed to show up at a court-appointed day in November.</p> <p>Until 1993 when President François Mitterand loosened restrictions, French parents had to choose their baby names from a list of legally acceptable options, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/26/france-baby-name-nutella_n_6547254.html" target="_blank">the <em>Huffington Post</em> reports</a>. Today, birth certificate registrars are still obligated to report to local courts if a baby name seems like it might have harmful effects for the child. Once reported, a judge can decide whether to ban the name or not.</p> <p>Here at ALL YOU, we have <a href="http://www.allyou.com/food/recipes/nutella-recipes" target="_blank">six irresistible Nutella recipes</a> you can make at home to pay homage to our favorite hazelnut spread that doesn’t involve subjecting your innocent children to years of ridicule and puzzled looks. They include Nutella-banana pizza, Nutella swirl blondies, banana-Nutella muffins, Nutella and strawberry crepes, molten chocolate-Nutella pudding cakes, and Nutella cheesecake dip. *drool*</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>You Might Also Like:</strong><br /> <strong><a href="http://www.allyou.com/food/recipes/nutella-recipes" target="_blank">6 Irresistible Nutella Recipes »</a></strong><br /> <strong> <a href="http://dailysavings.allyou.com/2012/11/09/pinterest-roundup-nutella-makes-everything-taste-better/" target="_blank">Pinterest Roundup: Nutella Makes Everything Taste Better »</a></strong><br /> <strong> <a href="http://www.allyou.com/food/healthy-breakfast" target="_blank">Build a Better, Healthier Breakfast »</a></strong></p> <p><em>Photo credit: A.

Have a question for the ladies? Post them with the hashtag <strong>#aycouponquestions</strong> and they might get featured here! </em></p> <p><strong>QUESTION: How can I make the most of my store rewards cards?</strong></p> <p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>From exclusive discount prices to reward points that turn into cash and savings at the gas pump, I think it’s “krazy” not to have a rewards card—or several of them. The key to maximizing all that a rewards card, also referred to as “loyalty” card, has to offer is knowing exactly what extras are available to you and how to use them to your advantage.</p> <p>I’m always looking for ways not only to save money, but to also earn extras. The more a store can offer me in perks and savings, the more likely I’m going to shop there. Fortunately, most good retailers know the value of keeping its shoppers happy is by rewarding them through reward programs.</p> <p><strong>Where to find the stores with the best rewards</strong></p> <p>Most major retailers now offer free rewards cards. Some of my favorites include <a href="http://fave.co/1DxneAq" target="_blank">Target</a>, <a href="https://www.kroger.com/" target="_blank">Kroger</a> and <a href="http://fave.co/1xkSPUj" target="_blank">Walgreens</a>. I’m going to shop there anyway, so I might as well have the card and gain some benefits, right?</p> <p>I love Target so much, my husband says I live there—and I admit, I do shop there a lot, but I make sure to take advantage of all the REDcard benefits. One of my favorite Target REDcard perks is the 5% discount I receive with every transaction. Believe me, that 5% adds up if you’re there as often as I am! Target REDcard also offers free shipping for online purchases and as a cardholder, I get an extra 30 days for returns outside of the standard 30-day return policy. What’s great is, you can choose between a REDcard credit card or a REDcard debit card. Both options give the same benefits.</p> <p><strong>Exclusive prices for loyal shoppers</strong></p> <p>Most stores offer weekly deals and in-store savings. In order to receive these specials, you’ll need to use the store’s loyalty card. Once you’ve registered for a card, it’s as easy as scanning it at the register or entering in your phone number at checkout. Savings are then automatically applied.</p> <p><strong>Turn points into money</strong></p> <p>For every dollar amount I spend at a store like <a href="https://www.fredmeyer.com/" target="_blank">Fred Meyer</a>, I earn points that transfer into money. At Kroger, I receive my earnings every quarter in the form of a Fred Meyer check. To earn points, all I do is purchase the products that are in the promotion. The reward points I accrue will automatically be added to my card. I can verify point totals by checking my online account or even by looking at my receipt. (A running total is shown on the bottom.)</p> <p><strong>Digital eCoupons </strong></p> <p>If you haven’t visited your grocery store website, go now! There’s a section on most websites for digital coupons. These coupons are manufacturer coupons much like the ones you’d find in the Sunday newspaper or online to print. To get them, log onto your store account, access the coupon page and select whichever coupons you think you’ll use. They’ll be loaded onto your store rewards card automatically and will be applied at checkout when you input your rewards account.</p> <p><strong>Savings on gas</strong></p> <p>Many grocery stores like Kroger, <a href="http://fave.co/1JYjZTQ" target="_blank">Safeway</a>, and <a href="http://www.albertsons.com/#2" target="_blank">Albertsons</a> offer fuel perk programs. By spending a certain amount at their store, you’ll earn discounts for future gas purchases. I spend enough on groceries that it only takes a few weeks to earn up to $0.50 off per gallon at Kroger. That’s amazing! Grocery stores will sometimes feature a double-point day where your dollars count extra towards fuel credit. This is only available to cardholders.</p> <p><strong>Personalized deals</strong></p> <p>Having a store rewards card lets a store track what you buy and how much you spend. This leads to special savings or specific discounts. <a href="http://www.cvs.com/" target="_blank">CVS</a> often sends me an exclusive offer for $5 off any purchase of $20 or more along with other store coupons. Now you know why it’s important and valuable to register your card online in order to have access to these benefits and promotions.</p> <p>Having a store rewards card is an easy and convenient way to earn exclusive discount prices, reward points that turn into cash, and fantastic savings at the gas pump.</p> <p><em><strong> — Heather and Joanie, <a href="http://thekrazycouponlady.com/" target="_blank">The Krazy Coupon Lady</a></strong></em></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>You Might Also Like: <br /> <a href="http://thekrazycouponlady.com/tips/style/11-fab-beauty-rewards-programs-can-really-use/" target="_blank">11 Beauty Rewards Programs You Can Really Use » <br /> </a><a href="http://thekrazycouponlady.com/tips/couponing/9-nearly-expired-stockpile-items-can-repurpose/" target="_blank">9 Nearly-Expired Stockpile Items That You Can Repurpose »</a></strong><br /> <strong> <a href="http://thekrazycouponlady.com/tips/travel/missing-using-travel-rewards-credit-card/" target="_blank">What You’re Missing by Not Using a Travel Rewards Credit Card »</a></strong></p> <p><em>Photo credit: Antenna/Getty Images</em></p>]]></description><author>The Krazy Coupon Lady</author><category>Lifestyle &amp; Food</category><source>All You</source><channel>Rminutemag1.2295</channel><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Time Inc.

But that’s just the beginning. Soup up your time in the kitchen with these handy tips and tricks using your smartphone or tablet (plus a few extra accessories!)</p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>1. Digitize your favorite recipes:</strong> </span>Is your recipe file a sauce-splattered mess? Organize those precious papers alongside your favorite recipes from other digital sources (like our own  <a href="http://www.allyou.com/food/supercheap-meals">Supercheap Meals</a>) using the <a href="https://evernote.com/food/" target="_blank">Evernote Food app</a> (free, Android, Apple). Type in your favorite dishes, snap a shot using your phone or clip recipes from your favorite websites with a few taps. Best of all, Evernote Food syncs to all your devices, so you can access the same recipes on your smartphone, tablet or desktop.</p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>2. Keep track of food expiration dates:</strong> </span><span class="s2">SmarTrack storage containers </span>(from $4; <a href="http://fave.co/1ILDf6q" target="_blank">cuisinart.com</a>) can help you use up leftovers before they go bad. Simply scan a container’s built-in QR code and program into the free app what type of food you’re storing (raw or cooked, meat or produce, for example). It calculates the food’s expiration date and sends a phone alert when the spoil-by day is approaching. The BPA-free containers are dishwasher- and microwave-safe.</p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>3. Know exactly when the chicken is done:</strong> </span>Free yourself from baby-sitting the oven with a Bluetooth-enabled thermometer such as the <span class="s2">Kitchen Thermometer Mini</span> ($40; <a href="http://fave.co/14Ymrgi" target="_blank">amazon.com</a>). It sends a push notification  <span style="line-height:1.5;">to your phone after your </span><span style="line-height:1.5;">food reaches the correct temperature. Great for any oven or stovetop cooking.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>4. Light up kitchen counters and storage spaces:</strong> </span>Can’t quite see what you’re chopping on the counter? <span class="s2">Mr. Beams wireless LED slim lights</span> ($25 for a set of 2; <a href="http://fave.co/14Yn3Cl" target="_blank">brookstone.com</a>) mount onto any surface, are battery-operated—no complicated wiring!—and have built-in motion sensors, so you won’t have to fumble for the switch. They’re ideal for dark pantries, too!</p> <p class="p1"><strong>5. Learn new recipes from the pros:</strong> The <a href="http://www.sidechef.com/#features" target="_blank">SideChef app</a> (Android, Apple) provides step-by-step narrated instructions for thousands of blogger-submitted recipes. It also sets a timer for any relevant part of the meal prep (like alerting you when to stop sautéing onions). It even responds to voice commands—which spares your device from being smeared by sticky fingers.</p> <p class="p1"><strong>You Might Also Like:</strong><br /> <a href="http://dailysavings.allyou.com/2015/01/14/winter-seasonal-produce/" target="_blank"><strong>The Best Winter Fruits and Veggies to Cook With (Plus, Recipes!) »</strong></a><br /> <a href="http://dailysavings.allyou.com/2015/01/13/freezing-food-tips/" target="_blank"><strong>11 Foods You Should Never Freeze »</strong></a><br /> <a href="http://dailysavings.allyou.com/2015/01/09/coffee-facts/" target="_blank"><strong>5 Myths About Coffee, Debunked! »</strong></a></p> <p class="p1"><em>Photo Credit: Erik Khalitov/Getty Images</em></p></p>]]></description><author>Jessie Van Amburg, Editorial Assistant</author><category>Lifestyle &amp; Food</category><source>All You</source><channel>Rminutemag1.2295</channel><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Time Inc.

Save more. Spend less. Be a gym rat—and actually like it.</p> <p>These are some of the <a href="http://www.statisticbrain.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/" target="_blank">most common New Year’s resolutions</a>, with many people pledging to actually tackle <em>all</em> of the above over the next 12 months.</p> <p>It makes perfect sense: According to a bevy of research, if you’re doing well in the health department, you’re probably in good financial shape too—and vice versa.</p> <p>For example, a  <a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/06/25/0956797614540467.abstract" target="_blank">study</a> out of the Olin Business School at Washington University in St. Louis found that future-minded people who contributed to a 401(k) were more likely to take steps to improve their health.</p> <p>Another University of Michigan  <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/111/48/17087.short" target="_blank">study</a> found that low credit scores could be used to predict increased risk of cardiovascular disease.</p> <p>These findings may seem discouraging if you haven’t been living (or spending) healthily—but researcher Salomon Israel, a coauthor of the Michigan study, says there’s an opportunity to turn it around.</p> <p>“It is not [necessarily] lack of exercise or poor diet, per se, that is leading to poor financial choices,” Israel says. “Rather, a person who possesses the skills to better manage their health is more likely to possess the skills to better manage their finances.”</p> <p>To help you refine those skills, we’re delving into how five key aspects of your health can influence your money—from how much slumber you clock each night to whether your stress levels are in the stratosphere.</p> <p><strong>Related: <a href="http://www.learnvest.com/2013/08/do-you-overspend-on-fitness-10-real-people-share-their-workout-costs/" target="_blank">Do You Overspend on Fitness? 10 Real People Share Their Workout Costs »</a></strong></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>1. How Sleep Affects Your Finances</strong></p> <p>Remember those all-nighters you used to pull in college before midterms?</p> <p>Science has an explanation for the wooziness you felt right before you crashed: Going without sleep for 24 or more hours makes a person perform as if they had a blood-alcohol level of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1739867/pdf/v057p00649.pdf" target="_blank">.1%</a>—.02% more than the legal limit for drunk driving.</p> <p>Most likely, all-nighters aren’t your M.O. anymore, but if you’re consistently getting just four or five hours of sleep a night, your decision-making skills may not be as sharp as they could be. And that can have implications for your money.</p> <p>“Lack of sleep can cause us to make  <em>many</em> poor decisions, all leading to negative financial consequences,” says Bob Gavlak, a CFP with Strategic Wealth Partners in Seven Hills, Ohio. “It could be as simple as buying a magazine that you don’t need at the grocery, or as big as drastically overpaying for a new car.”</p> <p><strong>Related: <a href="http://www.learnvest.com/2011/03/sleep-tight-three-ways-to-get-better-sleep-287/" target="_blank">Sleep Tight: Three Ways To Get Better Sleep Now »</a></strong></p> <p><strong>How to Get Healthier</strong> The first step is to commit to an earlier bedtime in order to get the recommended  <a href="http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/sleep/conditioninfo/pages/how-much.aspx" target="_blank">seven to nine hours</a> of sleep each night.</p> <p>And make sure to follow proper <a href="http://sleepfoundation.org/bedroom/" target="_blank">sleep hygiene</a>, like hanging room-darkening window treatments, setting your thermostat to about 65 degrees, and avoiding the use of electronics (like that smartphone!) before hitting the sheets.</p> <p>If nine hours seems too tall an order, look instead for windows in your day to catch a quick, 10-minute power nap. A <a href="http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/sleep-helps-learning-memory-201202154265" target="_blank">Harvard study</a> showed that napping can increase memory and cognitive function, which may just be the boost you need to be more alert at work—and make smarter money decisions.</p> <p>So catch up on some extra winks on the train to work, or on a Saturday afternoon, and soon enough, a financially productive 2015 won’t just be a dream.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>2. How Diet Affects Your Finances</strong></p> <p>Eating too many restaurant meals is a hallmark of <a href="http://www.cspinet.org/new/pdf/lit_rev-eating_out_and_obesity.pdf" target="_blank">poor nutrition</a>—those who indulge too often have higher levels of obesity, body fat and unhealthy BMIs.</p> <p>Plus, as anyone carefully tracking his expenses can attest to, dining out can also wreak havoc on your wallet. According to the <a href="http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/sites/default/files/usda_food_plans_cost_of_food/CostofFoodJul2014.pdf" target="_blank">USDA</a>, a family of four eating moderately at home will spend about $245 per week on food—that’s half of what they’d shell out eating at restaurants.</p> <p>And there’s more: It seems that eating high-fat restaurant meals may also affect cognitive abilities. In an Oxford University <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/08/090811143548.htm" target="_blank">lab study</a>, researchers found that rats eating a high-fat diet for several days showed signs of short-term memory loss and lower levels of brain function than those receiving a low-fat diet over the same period.</p> <p>“There are a lot of parallels between good eating habits and good financial habits,” says Jeff Reeves, author of “ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Frugal-Investors-Guide-Finding-Stocks-ebook/dp/B007KB9CSI" target="_blank">The Frugal Investor’s Guide to Finding Great Stocks</a>.” “If you don’t have the discipline to say no to junk food or count calories, you probably make a lot of impulse buys and have trouble balancing your checkbook. Self-control is the key to good financial health, as well as a healthy diet.”</p> <p><strong>How to Get Healthier: </strong>“A good tip for your nutrition and finances is to plan your meals in advance,” Gavlak says. “Even if you plan to go out for a few meals during the week, it still helps prevent gut decisions to stop at a restaurant instead of eating a good, home-cooked meal.”</p> <p>And feel free to take a few short-cuts if it means you’ll be motivated to maintain your healthy diet.</p> <p>“Don’t feel guilty about spending a little extra money for prewashed spinach or precut carrots,” says Marguerita Cheng, a CFP and C.E.O. of Blue Ocean Global Wealth in Rockville, Md. “If it means you eat at home and you eat better, it’s worth it.”</p> <p>Bonus tip: Instead of filling up on empty calories, add more energy-boosting foods to your diet, like <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22254047" target="_blank">almonds</a> and  <a href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/ar/archive/aug07/aging0807.htm?pf=1" target="_blank">blueberries</a>, so you’ll have a clear mind to tackle your financial to-dos.</p> <p><strong>Related: <a href="http://www.learnvest.com/2013/08/7-trendy-super-foods-are-they-worth-the-extra-money/" target="_blank">7 Trendy Super Foods: Are They Worth the Extra Money? »</a></strong></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>3. How Exercise Affects Your Finances</strong></p> <p>We won’t sugarcoat it. Exercising regularly is no easy feat. But skip this good-for-you habit, and you’re likely to sacrifice more than just a smaller pant size.</p> <p>For starters, regular exercise results in <a href="http://jap.physiology.org/content/early/2011/07/28/japplphysiol.00343.2011" target="_blank">more energy for your brain</a>, boosting your cognitive ability and sharpening your memory. So one consequence of staying sedentary could be that you’re operating at a significant disadvantage at work, compared to your more active coworkers.</p> <p>You could also be missing out on a positive attitude that could help you tackle your finances head-on. “Exercise can improve <a href="http://learnvest.cachefly.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/LearnVest-Financial-Confidence-Curve.pdf" target="_blank">confidence</a>, which can help people make more informed decisions and take the meaningful actions necessary to reach their goals,” Cheng says.</p> <p>In fact, Cheng says she often comes up with many of her most creative ideas after attending a cardio kickboxing or Zumba fitness class.</p> <p><strong>Related: <a href="http://www.learnvest.com/2013/04/i-paid-off-15000-of-debt-training-for-a-marathon/" target="_blank">I Paid Off $15,000 of Debt … Training for a Marathon »</a></strong></p> <p><strong>How to Get Healthier: </strong>To fully gain the health benefits from exercise, try to clock about <a href="http://www.health.gov/paguidelines/guidelines/chapter4.aspx" target="_blank">two and a half hours</a> of exercise each week. If you need to ease into it, make it fun by incorporating more physical activity into your daily schedule—like, say, biking to work instead of driving, or watching your favorite TV show while on the elliptical.</p> <p>The upshot? You’ll start to notice the benefits of sticking to healthy habits.</p> <p>“In turn, you can take that experience and apply it to your financial goals,” Gavlak says. “If you want to pay off debt, increase your savings, or be ready to retire early, you’ll need discipline to stick to a long-term plan, much like regular exercise.”</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>4. How Stress Affects Your Finances</strong></p> <p>Sure, a healthy level of stress can keep you motivated to stay on task and get things done. But, these days, many Americans suffer from <em>unhealthy</em> amounts of stress—which can lead to decreased productivity at the office.</p> <p>Recent <a href="http://www.towerswatson.com/en/Press/2014/09/Workplace-stress-leads-to-less-productive-employees" target="_blank">research</a> from professional services firm Towers Watson shows that, among workers who say they are experiencing high stress levels, 57% reported that they were disengaged at work. The stressed-out crowd also said they missed more work than their peers.</p> <p>What’s more, stress can take a toll on your wallet. “Just as there may be stress-eating, there may be stress-spending,” Cheng says.</p> <p>Even though many call it “retail therapy,” Cheng says this kind of emotional spending leads to more problems than solutions.</p> <p><strong>How to Get Healthier: </strong>Reducing stress may seem like a giant undertaking—but even baby steps can make a difference to your well-being.</p> <p>“Try to notice patterns as to what causes stress, and how you react to it. Then, instead of buying things as a result, focus on <em>doing</em> things,” Cheng says. So whenever you need a break, pick up a good book, call a friend, or go for a jog.</p> <p>Another big stress reliever? De-cluttering.</p> <p>To help you feel more in control, reorganize your physical space and get rid of unnecessary things. If you can, apply this treatment to your schedule too. Giving up activities that are unfulfilling or unnecessary can provide more free time for yourself—and the things that really matter to you.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>5. How Depression Affects Your Finances</strong></p> <p>Stress isn’t the only negative emotion that can lead to overspending— <a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/jenniferlerner/files/www.jenniferlerner.com__5.pdf" target="_blank">sadness</a> has been proven to have the same effect … with some pretty serious, straightforward financial consequences.</p> <p>In fact, individuals over 50 with debt have been found to be  <em>eight times</em> more likely to report feeling depressed than those who live comfortably, according to <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/debtridden-over50s-more-likely-to-suffer-mentalhealth-problems-9086647.html" target="_blank">research analysis</a> conducted at the University of Bristol in the UK.</p> <p><strong>How to Get Healthier:</strong> Public policies, like the Affordable Care Act, are making strides to improve Americans’ health—and therefore the resulting negative financial outcomes—by providing broader insurance coverage to more people.</p> <p>Having access to physicians, mental health support, and medications is certainly one piece of the puzzle—but there are actionable ways to reduce your financial burden on your own too.</p> <p>For starters, you can adopt the “snowball” method of paying off debt. You list out all of your debts, and rank them according to the highest interest rate. From there, you pay the minimum on each, but tackle the highest-interest card with full force. Once that debt is paid off, you move onto paying off the next high-interest debt and the next—until you’re completely debt-free.</p> <p>If, along the way, you notice a depressed mood is continuing to sideline your progress, Gavlak suggests building in some “thinking time” before you pull the trigger on new purchases.</p> <p>“If you see a pair of shoes and think you just <em>have</em> to have them, wait a couple of days before buying them,” Gavlak says. “After that, if you still want them and can afford them, go ahead. But often, you’ll find that you don’t really need or want that item like you thought you did.”</p> <p><strong>Related:  <a href="http://www.learnvest.com/2014/08/debt-got-you-down-5-tips-for-managing-the-money-blues-123/" target="_blank">Debt Got You Down? 5 Tips for Managing the Money Blues »</a></strong></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>You Might Also Like: <br /> <a href="http://www.learnvest.com/2014/04/save-money-health/" target="_blank">8 Easy Ways to Curb Health and Wellness Costs »</a><br /> <a href="http://www.learnvest.com/2014/09/financially-fit/" target="_blank">3 Ways Managing Your Money Can Be Like Getting in Shape » <br /> </a><a href="http://www.learnvest.com/2015/01/weight-wealth-is-your-waistline-impacting-your-bottom-line-123/" target="_blank">Weight &amp; Wealth: Is Your Waistline Impacting Your Bottom Line? »</a></strong></p> <p><em>Photo credit: Özgür GÜZ/Getty Images</em></p>]]></description><author>Our Partner, LearnVest</author><category>Lifestyle &amp; Food</category><source>All You</source><channel>Rminutemag1.2295</channel><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Time Inc.

It’s like getting two ingredients for the price of one. And the recipe for homemade broth from a pressure cooker could not be simpler:</p> <p><strong>1. Soak dry beans</strong> in salted water—covered and refrigerated—overnight. Or do what I do: Put beans into salted water to soak before you leave for work, and then cook them when you get home.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Drain beans</strong>. (Don’t worry about rinsing.)</p> <p><strong>3. Put the beans in the cooker</strong>; cover them with 1 inch of water and add 1 tsp. salt and 2 bay leaves. I add a <a href="http://fave.co/1IyFAla" target="_blank">piece of kombu</a>, a dried seaweed sold in health-food stores; it doesn’t impart a strong flavor, but it’s rich in minerals and can help soften the beans.</p> <p><strong>4. Pressure-cook</strong> as you would normally.</p> <p><strong>5. Drain the beans again</strong>, reserving and then straining the liquid.</p> <p>I like to drink a cup right out of the cooker (don’t knock it till you’ve tried it!) and save the rest to use in recipes that call for broth.</p> <p>What’s your best tip for getting the most out of your pressure cooker?</p> <p class="p1"><b>You Might Also Like: <br /> </b><a href="http://dailysavings.allyou.com/2014/11/07/overnight-oats/?crlt.pid=camp.TLghe6Eyn8UO" target="_blank"><strong>The Quickest Healthy Breakfast Ever »</strong></a><br /> <a href="http://www.allyou.com/food/supercheap-meals/cheap-soup-recipes-0" target="_blank"><strong>Warm Up With Vegetable Soups »</strong></a><br /> <a href="http://www.allyou.com/food/family-meals/slow-cooker-recipe" target="_blank"><strong>Our 50 Favorite Slow-Cooker Recipes »</strong></a></p> <p><em>Photo credit: Darrya/Getty Images</em></p>]]></description><author>Beth Lipton, Food Director</author><category>Lifestyle &amp; Food</category><source>All You</source><channel>Rminutemag1.2295</channel><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Time Inc.

Use an edible marker (we found a <a href="http://fave.co/1JPFdU2" target="_blank">2-pack for $6 on amazon.com</a>), to doodle sweet nothings on the produce in your fruit bowl. <em>(h/t </em><a href="http://cakewhiz.com/valentines-day-fruits-with-messages/" target="_blank"><em>Cake Whiz</em></a><em>)</em></p> <p><a data-pin-do="embedPin" href="http://www.pinterest.com/pin/186688347029361027/"></a></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>2. </strong>Sometimes simple ideas are the best ones. If your significant other drives to work, decorate their dashboard with thoughtful paper Valentines. <em> (h/t <a href="http://www.bombshellbling.com/32-fun-and-flirty-ways-spoil-sweetie/" target="_blank">BombShellBling</a>)</em></p> <p><a data-pin-do="embedPin" href="http://www.pinterest.com/pin/562246334704657287/"></a></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>3.</strong> A <a href="http://fave.co/1JPJnv6" target="_blank">heart-shaped cookie cutter</a> comes in handy for more than just baking!

But the big project on my to-do list was my closet and dresser.</p> <p>It wasn’t that I had tons of clothes to get rid of (I regularly send bags to the online consignment shop  <a href="http://www.thredup.com/" target="_blank">thredUP</a>), but I couldn’t wait to try Kondo’s storage strategies for clothes. “The goal should be to organize the contents [of your closet or drawers] so that you can see where every item is at a glance, just as you can see the spines of the books on your bookshelf,” Kondo writes. “ <strong>The key is to store things standing up rather than laid flat</strong>.”</p> <p>I was initially skeptical about this method, but after trying it, I can say with confidence that I’ll never go back to folding my clothes horizontally. For one thing, it just looks nicer. I can see all my clothes at once (this makes coming up with an outfit in the morning much easier) and folding them in this way keeps the fabric smooth.</p> <p>Plus, it feels like I own more clothes, even though I’m storing them more efficiently. When my tops and pants were folded horizontally, I tended to favor items on the top of the pile while forgetting about those on the bottom. There was also the pesky problem of shirts getting squeezed behind a drawer when it was packed too tightly. (I’m convinced there’s a black hole behind my dresser drawers where all my missing T-shirts are hiding.)</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>To fold clothes vertically…</strong></p> <p>Start by folding the item in half lengthwise once, then repeat as necessary until it’s the correct height for the depth of our drawer. Kondo stresses the important of applying pressure to clothes as you’re folding them, since this will prevent items from wrinkling and make them easier to store. For sweaters and t-shirts, fold the sleeves behind the shirt so you’re left with a long rectangle before folding in half.  <em>(h/t <a href="http://www.oprah.com/home/Gayle-Kings-Closet-Photos-Closet-Organizing-Tips/5" target="_blank">Oprah</a>)</em></p> <p><a data-pin-do="embedPin" href="http://www.pinterest.com/pin/223843043949135328/"></a></p> <p> </p> <p>After you’ve folded your clothes, place them in the drawer so they fit snugly. Ideally, clothing should be a little shorter than the drawer so it can open and close easily. My dresser drawers are fairly shallow, so I fold my pants in half three times for them to fit.  <em>(h/t <a href="http://www.shewearssheshares.com/2011/11/jean-ius-alternative-way-to-store-your.html" target="_blank">She Wears She Shares</a>)</em></p> <p><a data-pin-do="embedPin" href="http://www.pinterest.com/pin/203154633164795553/"></a></p> <p> </p> <p>Socks, bras and underwear can be more of a challenge. Fold stockings and underwear vertically by folding them in half as you would a pair of pants—you’ll just need to make more folds for stockings and fewer for underwear. I like this idea of cutting shoeboxes in half to create separate compartments for them, too. <em>(h/t <a href="http://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/organizing/diy-drawer-dividers" target="_blank">Real Simple</a>)</em></p> <p><a data-pin-do="embedPin" href="http://www.pinterest.com/pin/327003622917617163/"></a></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>What do you think of this method?

We’re talking the kind of scarf you leave on all day, long after you’ve taken off your coat, because it keeps you cozy while making whatever you’re wearing look that much more pulled-together. <em>All You</em> editors weighed in on their favorite snuggly, cozy, wear-with-everything scarf picks:</p> <p class="p1"><strong>1.

When you live a block from the Hudson River like I do, you need lots layers to ward off the wintry wind.

It’s snowing. It’s all-around gross outside. You could <a href="http://www.allyou.com/budget-home/organizing-cleaning/organizers-closets" target="_blank">organize your closet</a>, or <a href="http://www.allyou.com/budget-home/organizing-cleaning/speed-clean-your-house" target="_blank">clean up around the house</a>, or <a href="http://www.allyou.com/budget-home/money-shopping/taxes" target="_blank">get ahead on your taxes</a>…OR you could hunker down and indulge in some binge-watching. We rounded up some great selections available on various streaming services for you to enjoy, no matter your mood.</p> <p><em><strong>If you’re looking for a laugh:</strong></em></p> <p><strong>Scrubs:</strong> Whatever your feelings about the polarizing Zach Braff, this charming show about a hospital of newly-minted doctors is what I like to call “popcorn TV”—fun and relaxing to watch. Its quirky humor is a refreshing change of pace from formulaic sit-coms and reality shows ( <em>Netflix, Hulu Plus</em>).</p> <p><strong>Airplane!: </strong>This is the stupidest, punniest, most ridiculous movie ever made—and that’s why it’s my favorite. High drama and hijinx ensue when an entire airplane crew becomes ill during a flight. Be prepared for cheap, slapstick laughs, and gasps of horror when you realize that somehow this movie is rated PG (although I definitely wouldn’t recommend it as a kid flick!) ( <em>Netflix</em>).</p> <p><em><strong>If you’re watching with the kids:</strong></em></p> <p><strong>Holes: </strong>Stanley Yelnats is a kid whose family is suffering from a terrible curse—one that causes only bad luck. Stuck digging holes in the dirt at the dried-up Camp Green Lake after being accused of stealing, Stanley learns that his family’s curse is somehow caught up in the camp itself. Bonus: read the book by Louis Sachar with your kids after watching the movie! ( <em>Netflix</em>)</p> <p><strong>Anastasia</strong><em>: </em>Because what screams “winter” like a movie about Russia? <em><span style="color:#000000;">Anastasia</span></em> ( <em>Netflix, Amazon</em>) is a musical about an orphan named Anya, who people believe is the long-lost Grand Duchess Anastasia. Historical inaccuracies aside, it’s a fun and beautifully-told story—one that you’ll enjoy watching as much as the kids!</p> <p><em><strong>If you’re excited about awards season:</strong></em></p> <p><strong>Boyhood: </strong>Currently <span style="color:#000000;"><b> </b>the darling of the awards circuit, <em>Boyhood</em> is an ambitious movie filmed over the course of 12 years that follows the adolescence of a young American boy</span> ( <em>Amazon, Google Play, iTunes</em>).</p> <p><strong>Grand Budapest Hotel:</strong> Nominated this year for Best Picture, <em>The Grand Budapest Hotel</em> is a classic Wes Anderson romp about the runnings of a luxury European resort. When a wealthy patron dies and leaves her most valuable possessions to the hotel’s manager (played by Ralph Fiennes), her family goes on the warpath to keep her inheritance in their hands ( <em>Amazon, iTunes, Google Play</em>).</p> <p><strong>Gone Girl: </strong>Probably one of my favorite movies of 2014, purely for Rosamund Pike’s epic (and Oscar-nominated!) performance as Amy Dunne, who goes missing on her five year anniversary. All evidence seems to point to her husband, Nick (Ben Affleck), but was he really responsible for her disappearance? Based on the novel by Gillian Flynn ( <em>Amazon, iTunes, On Demand</em>).</p> <p><em><strong>If you’re into the serious stuff:</strong></em></p> <p><strong>The Killing</strong>: Detective Sarah Linden is ready to move on from her life as a detective in Seattle, but one last case proves more complicated than it seems when missing teenager Rosie Larsen is found dead in the truck of a car. Rosie was caught up in something dark, and Sarah makes it her mission to untangle the threads surrounding her tragic death ( <em>Netflix</em>).</p> <p><strong>The Fall: </strong>Season Two of this gripping drama just hit Netflix, and its dark, addictive storytelling make it a perfect snow-day marathon candidate. Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson (played by Gillian Anderson) is called into Belfast to investigate a series of murders that look to be the work of a woman-hating serial killer. The hunt for the killer threatens to catch Gibson herself in a dangerous web of police politics and intrigue.</p> <p><em><strong>If you’re obsessed with Downton Abbey:</strong></em></p> <p><strong>Call the Midwife: </strong>Jump back in time to post-WW2 London, where a group of dedicated nurses tend to their poverty-stricken community. Like Downton Abbey, this show is a nice mix of the dramatic and the light hearted <strong> </strong>( <em>Netflix</em>).</p> <p><strong>Four Weddings and a Funeral: </strong>Swoon over Hugh Grant in all his floppy-haired 1990s glory with this highly entertaining British movie. Over the course of four weddings (and one funeral, per the title), a group of friends deals with love and loss, with determined bachelor Charles finding love where he least expects it ( <em>Netflix, Amazon</em>).</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>You Might Also Like:</strong><br /> <strong><a title="7 Affordable Gadgets to Keep You Warm and Help You Save Money" href="http://dailysavings.allyou.com/2015/01/26/winter-gadgets/" target="_blank">7 Gadgets to Keep You Warm and Help Sa</a><a href="http://dailysavings.allyou.com/2015/01/26/winter-gadgets/" target="_blank">ve Money »</a></strong><br /> <a href="http://dailysavings.allyou.com/2015/01/26/how-to-style-hat-hair/" target="_blank"><strong> Got Winter Hat Hair?

According to <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/brisket-shortage-has-texas-barbecue-lovers-facing-rising-costs/" target="_blank">CBS News</a>, brisket prices have increased 60% compared to last year, or up from an average of $2.21 per pound to $3.52 per pound.</p> <p class="p1">So where’s the beef? The shortage is being attributed to record droughts in Texas and California that have caused ranchers to thin their herds to the lowest levels in 60 years.

You’re towel-drying too aggressively.</strong><br /> Rubbing your wet hair down with a towel can disturb the cuticle and cause breakage and frizz. Instead, let your hair air dry a little, and then gently blot dry with a towel.</p><p><strong>2. You’re sleeping with wet hair.</strong><br /> We know, we know—thoroughly drying your hair after a late-night shower is the last thing you want to do before jumping into bed. However, sleeping on wet hair can cause frizziness in the morning due to the friction from your hair on the pillow as it dries overnight. Dry your hair at least halfway by blotting with a towel or using a low heat setting on your hair dryer.</p><p><strong>3. You’re using the wrong brush.</strong><br /> Wet hair + wrong kind of brush + aggressive brushing = a recipe for disaster. Wet hair follicles are especially fragile, meaning brushing incorrectly can lead to breakage. Instead, use a wide-tooth comb to brush through your hair while you condition or use a hair mask in the shower. This will help to gently distribute the formula evenly throughout your wet hair. Continue using your wider comb after towel drying your hair, and only move to brushes with finer bristles once your hair is dry.</p><p>Try: <a href="http://www.target.com/p/l-oreal-paris-advanced-haircare-total-repair-5-damage-erasing-balm-8-5-fluid-ounce/-/A-14337599#prodSlot=medium_1_10&amp;term=L%E2%80%99Or%C3%A9al+Paris+Advanced+Haircare+Total+Repair+5+Dam" target="_blank">L’Oréal Paris Advanced Haircare Total Repair 5 Damage Erasing Balm, $6; target.com</a></p><p><strong>4. You’re brushing from top to bottom.</strong><br /> Brushing from root to tip causes stress on locks, which can lead to knots and breakage. Instead, start combing at the ends to work out the worst kinks, and then work your way up to the scalp.</p><p><strong>5. You rely too heavily on heat.</strong><br /> Although easier said than done, applying heat to your hair should be done sparingly. Look at your ‘do and see what needs to be enhanced—maybe just a wave here, a bend there, or straightening out at the ends. Target these touchups to minimize heat damage and get out the door faster!</p><p><strong>6. You aren’t rotating your products enough.</strong><br /> A good rule of thumb when it comes to switching out your shampoo and conditioner is at the turn of every season, or after you get a new hair color.  Your tresses have different needs in the summer than it does in the winter. For example, using deep conditioners from dry summers can overcompensate the lightweight moisturizing needs of your winter locks, leaving them weighed down and lifeless.</p><p>Try: <a href="http://www.walmart.com/ip/Redken-Clear-Moist-Shampoo/15701923" target="_blank">Redken Clear Moist Shampoo, $13; walmart.com</a></p><p><strong>7. You’re applying product directly to your roots.</strong><br /> Applying product to your roots can leave hair looking limp. Start at the ends instead so your strands can absorb more of the product’s beneficial ingredients. Only products like root-lifting mousse or shampoo should be applied to the roots.</p><p><strong>8. Your updos are too tight.</strong><br /> Ponytail holders can be a girl’s best friend when it comes to bad hair days, but they can also be your hair’s worst enemy. Using a too-tight elastic on the same parts of your hair can cause frictional damage. Instead, use an elastic that’s covered, and switch up your updo or try a braid for a change of pace. Your locks will thank you.</p>]]></description><category>Lifestyle &amp; Food</category><source>All You</source><channel>Rminutemag1.2295</channel><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Time Inc.

Try These Genius Fixes</title><link>http://dailysavings.allyou.com/2015/01/26/how-to-style-hat-hair/</link><enclosure u="http://dailysavings.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/hat-hair-tips.jpg?w=640" t="image/jpeg" author=""/><description fullstory="1"><![CDATA[<p>Your mom was right: You should always wear a hat when it’s cold out. And with the temperatures continuing to plummet, there are still plenty of hat-days left this winter…Which means there are plenty of <em>hat-hair</em> days ahead too. Fight frizz, static, and creases with our quick solutions for hat hair disasters. With these tips, the oncoming polar vortex is no match for your silky, sleek strands.</p> <p><strong>Hat-Hair Problem: Static</strong></p> <p><strong>• Prevent it:</strong> We all know that awful feeling of taking off your hat and looking like you’ve just been electrocuted. To avoid clingy strands, try wrapping your hair in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Dfashion&amp;field-keywords=silk+scarf&amp;rh=n%3A7141123011%2Ck%3Asilk+scarf" target="_blank">silk scarf</a> before putting on your hat. Also be sure to cut back on the amount of times you wash your hair each week, says <a href="https://www.facebook.com/paulcucinello/timeline?ref=page_internal" target="_blank">hairstylist Paul Cucinello</a>. “In the colder months super-clean hair gets very ‘staticky’ very easily.”</p> <p><strong>• Fix it:</strong> To tame those unruly flyaways, Cucinello recommends carrying fabric softener or dryer sheets with you wherever you go. “If you arrive at your destination and discover that your hair is standing straight up, use a dryer sheet to calm down static by gently running it along your hair, following the shape you are currently wearing.”</p> <p><strong><strong>Hat-Hair Problem: </strong>Flatness</strong></p> <p><strong>• Prevent it:</strong> After spending the little time that we have to ourselves styling our hair in the morning, the last thing we want is to mess it all up in 30 seconds flat by wearing a hat. The solution? A ballerina bun. Cucinello suggests pulling your hair up into a <a href="http://emmceeburnedabee.tumblr.com/post/25533030770" target="_blank">high chignon</a> at the crown of your head before putting on your hat to ensure that your hair retains its volume.</p> <p><strong>• Fix it:</strong> If <a href="http://fave.co/1JtZmP6" target="_blank">dry shampoo</a> isn’t already in your beauty arsenal, it’s time to make this product one of your staples. While dry shampoo helps to combat grease, it also helps to keep strands bouncy and full of life. Once you take off your cap, spray dry shampoo for instantly refreshed roots, suggests Cucinello. If that’s not enough—and we’ve all been there—try spraying a little <a href="http://fave.co/1zDxPuB" target="_blank">volumizing spray</a> throughout the hair as well for an added pick-me-up.</p> <p><strong>Hat-Hair Problem:</strong>  <strong>Creases</strong></p> <p><strong>• Prevent it:</strong> To keep hair from acquiring those inconvenient ridges, try opting for a hat that does not contain elastic. The tighter the hat is on your head, the deeper—and more obvious—the crease will be. To further ensure crease-proof hair, try pulling hair together at the nape of the neck—or where your hat lies—and use Ricky’s NYC No-Crease Silver Metal Bow Clips 2 Pack ( <a href="http://fave.co/1Ju0hiA" target="_blank">$6; rickysnyc.com</a>) to hold hair in place.</p> <p><strong>• Fix it:</strong> If you take off your hat to reveal those pesky unwanted creases, try wetting the part of your hair where the crease is located. Allowing your hair to redry gives it the chance to work out any kinks your hat may have caused. If that doesn’t work, and you have beauty tools at your beck and call, try running a straightener over the crease.</p> <p> </p> <p class="p1"><b>You Might Also Like: <br /> </b><b><a href="http://www.allyou.com/style-for-less/budget-beauty/winter-beauty-tips" target="_blank">13 Winter Hair and Skin Tips »</a><br /> </b><b><a href="http://www.allyou.com/style-for-less/budget-beauty/bad-hair-habits" target="_blank">8 Ways You’re Ruining  Your Hair (And How to Fix It!) »</a><br /> </b><a href="http://www.allyou.com/style-for-less/budget-beauty/best-budget-beauty-buys/" target="_blank"><b>50 Best Beauty Buys of 2014 »</b></a></p> <p class="p1"><i>Photo credit: Tim Pannell/Getty Images</i></p>]]></description><author>carolinedavis1102</author><category>Lifestyle &amp; Food</category><source>All You</source><channel>Rminutemag1.2295</channel><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Time Inc.

They’re portable, delicious, and you can <em>usually</em> feel good knowing you’re eating something healthy. Unfortunately, many store-bought bars pack artificial sweeteners and other ingredients, like puffed rice, that add extra calories and can leave you feeling hungry just a couple hours later.</p> <p>Instead of buying a bar with who-knows-what in it, make a batch of these healthy on-the-go snacks for the week ahead.

Collect your refund…in cash.</strong></p> <p>Can’t wait for that check from the IRS? Now you can pick up a cash refund from—of all places— <a title="Walmart" href="http://fave.co/1FDoJiq" target="_blank">Walmart</a>. Customers who opt into the mega-retailer’s new <a href="http://news.walmart.com/news-archive/2015/01/20/walmart-launches-first-of-its-kind-cash-pickup-option-for-tax-refunds" target="_blank">Direct2Cash program </a>file through one of the partner tax preparers, after which they’ll receive an email notice and a code enabling them to immediately collect their refund at a Walmart store. The benefit is targeted especially to taxpayers who don’t have a checking account and want to save on check-cashing fees.</p> <p><strong>2. Take advantage of incentives.</strong></p> <p>Tax prep service <a title="Jackson Hewitt" href="http://offers.jacksonhewitt.com/tax-preparation/special-offers/visa-gift-card-50" target="_blank">Jackson Hewitt</a> is giving away $50—in the form of a Walmart eGift Card or prepaid Visa card— to their customers. The company has 6300 locations, including almost 3,000 operating out of Walmart stores.</p> <p><strong>3. TurboTax customer? You may be eligible for a rebate.</strong></p> <p>Intuit is refunding $25 to users of its Turbo Tax Deluxe 2013 program who were forced this year to upgrade to a more expensive program, even if their tax prep didn’t change. The move is in response to consumer complaints that the 2014 version of <a title="TurboTax Deluxe" href="https://turbotax.intuit.com/25back" target="_blank">TurboTax Deluxe</a> no longer supports Schedules C, D, E and F—as it did last year. Hoping to lure some TurboTax clients,  <a title="H&amp;R Block" href="http://newsroom.hrblock.com/hr-block-offers-free-software-turbotax-users/" target="_blank">H&amp;R Block</a> is offering its own Deluxe + State software free to those who already purchased Turbo Tax’s Basic or Deluxe 2014 software.</p> <p><strong>4. Beware of exploitative tax preparers.</strong></p> <p><a title="The National Consumer Law Center" href="http://dailysavings.allyou.com/http://www.nclc.org/images/pdf/high_cost_small_loans/ral/pr-tax-time-2015.pdf" target="_blank">The National Consumer Law Center </a>and <a title="Consumer Federation of America" href="http://www.consumerfed.org" target="_blank">Consumer Federation of America</a> are warning the public to take extra care when hiring a tax preparer, since most “are not subject to any minimum educational, training, or competency standards.” Risks include using a service that gives an inaccurate quote or none at all, commits fraud or files for the incorrect amount. Taxpayers are also being advised to steer clear of costly and unnecessary products, such as refund anticipation checks (RACs), which carry large fees from the both the tax preparer and bank. Low-income taxpayers may be able to take advantage of free or inexpensive options, through the <a title="VITA" href="http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Free-Tax-Return-Preparation-for-You-by-Volunteers" target="_blank"> VITA</a> sites or  <a title="AARP Tax-Aide" href="http://www.aarp.org/money/taxes/aarp_taxaide/" target="_blank">AARP Tax-Aide</a>.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>You Might Also Like: <br /> <a title="Learn the Important Tax Terms" href="http://www.allyou.com/budget-home/money-shopping/tax-terms" target="_blank">Learn the Important Tax Terms » <br /> </a><a title="Get Help Filing Taxes" href="http://www.allyou.com/budget-home/money-shopping/filing-taxes" target="_blank">Get Help Filing Taxes » <br /> </a><a title="Save Money With Tax Credits" href="http://www.allyou.com/budget-home/money-shopping/tax-credits" target="_blank">Save Money With Tax Credits »</a></strong></p> <p><em>Photo credit: svetikd/Getty Images</em></p>]]></description><author>Dulcy Israel, Senior Editor</author><category>Lifestyle &amp; Food</category><source>All You</source><channel>Rminutemag1.2295</channel><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Time Inc.

(Anybody else order dessert—with a side of pizza—just to celebrate that it’s Friday night?) Nutritionist  <a href="http://jswnutrition.com/" target="_blank">Julie Starr</a>, who developed the nutrition program at the newly opened healthy restaurant <a href="http://www.darrowsnyc.com/#darrows" target="_blank">Darrow’s</a>, has a few tips on how to make choices that support your healthy eating goals—even when you’re out at a restaurant or ordering in for the night.</p> <p><strong>• Plan ahead.</strong> Check the restaurant’s menu online before heading out to get a sense of their healthier options. Going in with a mission plan will help you steer clear of their more indulgent menu items.</p> <p><strong>• Stay hydrated.</strong> Have a glass of water before you eat to curb your appetite and prevent overeating.</p> <p><strong>• Don’t wait until you’re starving to eat.</strong> If your stomach starts grumbling before you leave the house, have a piece of fruit or a handful of nuts so you don’t arrive at the restaurant with eyes bigger than your stomach.</p> <p><strong>• Look for keywords.</strong> Go for dishes described as fresh, steamed, roasted, pan-seared or grilled. Healthier dishes often mention the aromatic herbs and spices used to flavor the food (not to mention, they offer great health benefits and no calories). Infused broths and tomato-based dishes are lighter alternatives to creamier options.</p> <p><strong>• Avoid the fillers. </strong>Steer clear of anything described as rich, creamy or au gratin, which all point to dishes heavy on the fat and dairy. Breaded, fried, roux (a dish with a base of flour and fat), candied and pan-fried are also indicators of less healthy options.</p> <p><strong>• Pass the bread. </strong>Unless the bread is especially delicious and you rarely go to that restaurant, Starr suggests skipping the bread basket altogether. Eating a light snack beforehand can make it easier to pass on the starter, too.</p> <p><strong>• Add more color. </strong>A good sign of a healthy, well balanced meal is a variety of bright colors. Try something that’s loaded in colorful fruits, veggies, herbs, beans and lean proteins.</p> <p><strong>• Chew your food thoroughly.</strong> Instead of rushing through your meal, give your body enough time to recognize that it is getting full.</p> <p><strong>• Stick to veggies for your side. </strong>Up your daily veggie intake instead of opting for the tempting fried and starchy side options. Don’t forget to ask for salad dressing on the side so you can better control how much goes on your leafy greens.</p> <p><strong>• Watch your portion sizes.</strong> Almost all restaurants will over-serve you with a larger portion size than suggested for one sitting. Try ordering an appetizer for an entree, split something with a friend, or have the restaurant give you a to-go box for that extra portion. If you tend to forget to ask for a to-go box at the end of your meal, ask for one when your dish is delivered and divide up your meal right away . You’ll be less tempted to overeat once the extra food is stowed away.</p> <p><strong>• Dish out your takeout. </strong>When you’re ordering in rather than eating out, instead of eating straight from the containers (no judgment—we all do it!) serve your food up on real plates. Once you’ve dished out your servings, put all leftover containers back in the fridge. Out of sight, out of mind.</p> <p><strong>• Don’t punish yourself. </strong>You can’t always control all your options, especially when you’re not the one in charge of the menu. Just remember to look for a BETTER option—it doesn’t always have to be the “best” one. Remain accountable for your decisions, whatever they are, and don’t feel guilty about it. One “bad” decision will not ruin your health and fitness goals.</p> <p><strong>Tell us: What are your tips to sticking to your healthy eating goals?</strong></p> <p> </p> <p class="p1"><b>You Might Also Like: <br /> </b><b><a href="http://www.allyou.com/diet-fitness/health-challenge" target="_blank">Take the Ultimate All You 12-Week Health Challenge! »</a><br /> </b><b><a href="http://www.allyou.com/diet-fitness/nutrition/fast-metabolism" target="_blank">Eat Your Way to Fast Metabolism »</a><br /> </b><a href="http://www.allyou.com/diet-fitness/nutrition/flat-belly-foods" target="_blank"><b>Fuel Up On Slimming Foods »</b></a></p> <p class="p1"><i>Photo credit: Dave and Les Jacobs/Getty Images</i></p>]]></description><author>Jennifer Liu, Digital Editorial Assistant</author><category>Lifestyle &amp; Food</category><source>All You</source><channel>Rminutemag1.2295</channel><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Time Inc.

There are <a href="http://dailysavings.allyou.com/2014/06/06/clean-in-dishwasher/" target="_blank">a surprising number of things you can clean</a> in these time-saving machines: your keys, toothbrush or or sponges, just to name a few. And if you’re feeling extra creative—or daring—you can even <a href="http://dailysavings.allyou.com/2013/09/20/dishwasher-cooking/" target="_blank">cook dinner in your dishwasher</a>.</p> <p>But knowing what you can and can’t put in your dishwasher might not be as easy as finding a “dishwasher safe” label on your trusty cookware and utensils. To save you the trouble and heartache of warped dishes and cracked glasses, here’s a list of items that should never go through your dishwasher.</p> <p><strong>• Cast iron: </strong>Your multi-tasking cast iron skillet <a href="http://dailysavings.allyou.com/2015/01/09/how-to-clean-a-cast-iron-skillet/" target="_blank">needs a little more TLC</a> than throwing it into the dishwasher. Putting a cast iron pan into the dishwasher can cause the pan to be stripped of its seasoning.</p> <p><strong>• Crystal:</strong> Fine crystal is too delicate to withstand high heat and dish detergent particles, both of which can chip or crack your glassware.</p> <p><strong>• Non-stick pots and pans:</strong> If you subject your non-stick cookware to the heat and cleaning solutions of your dishwashing cycle, you run the risk of your Teflon pans losing their “non-stick” qualities.</p> <p><strong>• Wooden utensils:</strong> Repeated exposure to high heat and water can warp wooden utensils like wooden spoons and cutting boards. You’ll want to check your item’s care instructions before including it in the wash.</p> <p><strong>• Good knives:</strong> Running high-quality knives through the wash can dull their blades. Plus, wooden handles can also warp and become loose from the blade.</p> <p><strong>• Plastic:</strong> Hard plastics are usually OK if washed with caution and only on the top rack. Softer plastics (think your disposable yogurt cups) should be hand-washed or recycled after use.</p> <p><strong>• Gold, brass, and sterling silver:</strong> The chemical reaction between these metals and the cleaning solution of your dish detergent can cause your cookware’s finish to wear and color to change.</p> <p><strong>• Copper:</strong> High heat from your dishwasher can cause this metal cookware to soften and become dented during the wash cycle.</p> <p><strong>• China with gold leaf or painted patterns:</strong> This type of delicate dishware is subject to fading or discoloring if washed through the rigorous cycle of a dishwasher. Stick to the sink, a soft sponge and mild detergent instead.</p> <p><strong>• Disposable aluminum:</strong> The environment inside your dishwasher can cause black residue and unsightly marks to transfer from the aluminum to your other dishes.</p> <p><strong>• Insulated mugs:</strong> The insulating layers in your mug can keep your coffee hot during your morning routine, but including it in the dishwasher could lead water to become trapped between these layers.</p> <p><strong>• Dishes and utensils with adhesive labels:</strong> The cycles of hot water can cause the glue and the sticker to come off, which can end up clogging the machine. Make sure to completely remove any labels from your dishes before throwing them in the dishwasher.</p> <p> </p> <p class="p1"><b>You Might Also Like: <br /> </b><b><a href="http://dailysavings.allyou.com/2014/06/06/clean-in-dishwasher/" target="_blank">30 Items (Other Than Dishes) You Can Clean in the Dishwasher »</a><br /> </b><b><a href="http://dailysavings.allyou.com/2013/09/20/dishwasher-cooking/" target="_blank">Would You Cook Dinner in Your Dishwasher? »</a><br /> </b><a href="http://dailysavings.allyou.com/2014/06/12/household-laundry-cleaning/" target="_blank"><b>13 Surprising Thing You Can Clean in Your Washing Machine »</b></a></p> <p class="p1"><i>Photo credit: Lasse Kristensen/Getty Images</i></p>]]></description><author>Jennifer Liu, Editorial Assistant</author><category>Lifestyle &amp; Food</category><source>All You</source><channel>Rminutemag1.2295</channel><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Time Inc.

Researchers looked at public tweets made from 2009 to 2010 and found that communities who frequently tweeted angry things also had higher rates of death from heart disease. Meanwhile, using positive emotional language (like “friend” and “wonderful”) had the opposite effect, leading to a lowered risk of heart disease.</p> <p>While hostility and depression have been linked to heart disease, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/01/23/angry-twitter/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget&amp;?ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_reader=feedly" target="_blank">anger leads to many other health problems</a>. “Negative emotions can also trigger behavioral and social responses; you are also more likely to drink, eat poorly and be isolated from other people which can indirectly lead to heart disease,” said Margaret Kern, an assistant professor at the University of Melbourne and a contributor to the study.</p> <p>However, it isn’t necessarily the angry tweeter who gets stricken with heart disease. Rather, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/11363664/Angry-tweeting-could-increase-your-risk-of-heart-disease.html" target="_blank">the negativity creates a hostile social environment around the user that affects other people</a>. In other words—if you follow angry, negative people on Twitter, you’re putting your health at risk. It’s not clear yet whether this correlation applies to other social media platforms besides Twitter.</p> <p>So the next time you see a mean-spirited, hateful tweet from someone in your feed, simply unfollow them to remove yourself from their toxic environment. Shake off the haters à la Taylor Swift. Your heart will thank you for it.</p> <span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/nfWlot6h_JM?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span> <p> </p> <p><strong>You Might Also Like:</strong><br /> <a href="http://dailysavings.allyou.com/2015/01/07/best-diets-2015/" target="_blank"><strong>The Best Diets to Try for a Healthier 2015 »</strong></a><br /> <a href="http://dailysavings.allyou.com/2014/12/11/diy-cold-remedies/" target="_blank"><strong>5 DIY Cold Remedies »</strong></a><br /> <a href="http://dailysavings.allyou.com/2015/01/22/netflix-february-2015/" target="_blank"><strong>Check Out What’s New to Stream on Netflix in February »</strong></a></p> <p class="p1"><i>Photo credit: ViviSuArt/Getty Images</i></p>]]></description><author>Jessie Van Amburg, Editorial Assistant</author><category>Lifestyle &amp; Food</category><source>All You</source><channel>Rminutemag1.2295</channel><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Time Inc.

Four or more cups a day translated to a 20% risk reduction compared to those in the study who didn’t drink any coffee at all. It doesn’t seem quite clear yet what the association is between coffee and melanoma risk. It is important to know, however, that the risk reduction only applies to caffeinated coffee, not decaf. (So really, why are you still bothering with decaf?)</p> <p>However, these findings don’t mean that you can just drink coffee as a replacement for using sunscreen. “The most important thing a person can do to reduce risk is to reduce sun and ultraviolet light exposure,” said Erikka Loftfield, the lead author on the study.</p> <p>So coffee fans, don’t feel guilty about that extra cup, but certainly don’t skimp on normal precautions when going out in the sun.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>You Might Also Like:</strong><br /> <a href="http://dailysavings.allyou.com/2015/01/09/coffee-facts/" target="_blank"><strong>5 Myths About Coffee, Debunked! »</strong></a><br /> <a href="http://dailysavings.allyou.com/2014/11/27/uses-for-coffee-grounds/" target="_blank"><strong>15 Clever Ways to Use Up Old Coffee Grounds »</strong></a><br /> <a href="http://dailysavings.allyou.com/2014/12/16/keurig-2-0-hack/" target="_blank"><strong>How to Hack Your Keurig 2.0 and Save on Coffee »</strong></a></p> <p><em>Photo credit: Aleksandr Morozov/Getty Images</em><em> </em></p>]]></description><author>Jessie Van Amburg, Editorial Assistant</author><category>Lifestyle &amp; Food</category><source>All You</source><channel>Rminutemag1.2295</channel><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Time Inc.

If Family Dollar had accepted the higher bid from Dollar General, 4,000 stores would have had to close to prevent a monopoly in some markets, while with the accepted deal, only about 300 stores are expected to close.</p> <p><strong>Do you have a favorite dollar store?
