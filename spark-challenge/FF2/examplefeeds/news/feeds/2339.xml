The former Olympian will soon be living life as female. <br /><br />&quot;Bruce is transitioning to a woman,&quot; says a source close to the family. &quot;He is finally happy and his family is accepting of what he&apos;s doing. He&apos;s in such a great space. That&apos;s why it&apos;s the perfect time to do something like this.&quot; <br /><br />And according to a Jenner insider, the 65-year-old reality star is filming his momentous journey, to be shared with viewers on a docu-series this year. &quot;It will air when he is ready to be open about his transition,&quot; the source tells PEOPLE. &quot;But he&apos;s acting more and more confident and seems very happy.&quot; <br /><br />Jenner&apos;s much-documented physical appearance (he&apos;s been photographed with longer hair, manicured nails and wearing makeup) has led to much speculation, but according to the insider, Jenner&apos;s decision to transition slowly was made in part so that his family would have time to adapt to the change. <br /><br /> <br /><br />&quot;He&apos;s being very smart about and also respectful about his transition,&quot; the insider says. &quot;Instead of completely shocking everyone, his changes have been subtle, and his family has had the chance to slowly get used to his new looks and life.&quot; <br /><br />And his family, including children Cassandra, 34, Burt, 36 (with ex wife Chrystie Crownover ) and sons Brandon, 33 and Brody, 31 (with ex wife Linda Thompson), as well as daughters Kendall, 19 and Kylie, 17 (with Kris Jenner) are adjusting to the new Bruce. &quot;The [kids&apos;] concern seems to be Bruce&apos;s happiness, and he acts very pleased with his new life,&quot; says the insider. <br /><br />Admits the family source: &quot;It is an intense thing. Of course not everyone is 100 percent on board. Different people have different reactions. But everybody loves him.&quot; <br /><br />When <a href="http://www.people.com/article/kim-kardashian-bruce-jenner-his-mood" target="_blank">asked about Jenner</a> on <em>ET</em>, his stepdaughter <a class="celebdb" href="http://www.people.com/people/kim_kardashian">Kim Kardashian</a> simply said, &quot;I think everyone goes through things in life, and I think that story and what Bruce is going through, I think he&apos;ll share whenever the time is right.&quot; And when reached by PEOPLE, son Burt would only say his father is &quot;doing awesome.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;The family is really giving this space and time to Bruce. This is his story and they want him to tell the world the way he wants,&quot; the source close to the family says. &quot;They really want to empower him to tell his story so that hopefully he can help other people too. That&apos;s the goal.&quot; <br /><br />Now it appears that Jenner, finally happy in his own skin, will soon be ready to live life out in the open. &quot;He has come out to those closest to him,&quot; says the family source. &quot;He&apos;s so happy and excited. He gets to lay down a huge bag of bricks. He&apos;s been through a dark period and is coming out on the other side.&quot; <br /><br />Numerous requests for comment from Jenner and his representatives were met with no reply. <br /><br />&#149; <b>With reporting by PERNILLA CEDENHEIM</b></p>]]></description><category>Entertainment</category><source>People</source><channel>Rminutemag1.2365</channel><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Time Inc.

According to the video above, the pooch ended up producing milk. <br /><br />Along with providing nutrition for the kittens, Memory also offered the babies plenty of love and protection. <br /><br /> <br /><br />&quot;She&apos;s been very protective from day one,&quot; Williams said. <br /><br />&quot;She would carry them up on the couch with her. If they got up and started to walk to the edge of the couch she got up, picked them up with her mouth and laid them down with her.&quot; <br /><br />This behavior was especially surprising to Williams, who is used to her dog running away in fear from cats. <br /><br />Vets say that Memory&apos;s milk production, while shocking, isn&apos;t unheard of: The appearance of the needy kittens most likely triggered a false pregnancy, which can lead to an animal producing milk without having babies of their own. <br /><br />After several weeks of nursing from Memory, the kittens moved to solid food. Williams adopted out three of the now-healthy cats, but kept one for Memory to mother and shower with affection. <br /><br />&quot;[Memory] is still acting like a mom to the one that we kept,&quot; Williams said. And &quot;he still tries to nurse from her. She lets him for a minute and then starts playing with him.&quot; <br /><br /> <div class="fb-like-article-wrapper"> <div class="fb-like share-button" data-href="http://www.facebook.com/peoplemag" data-layout="button" data-action="like" data-show-faces="false" data-share="false"></div> <strong>Like us on Facebook for more stories like this!</strong> </div></p>]]></description><category>unknown</category><source>unknown</source><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Time Inc.

Sometimes, he just needs a little help. <br /><br />Every day, Caldwell, 82, drives to Lakeside Park in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, to visit the memorial bench he had installed to honor his wife of nearly 56 years, Betty, reports <a href="http://www.cbs58.com/story/27957210/true-love-and-kindness-a-fond-du-lac-love-story" target="_blank">WDJT</a>. <br /><br />Caldwell says having a moment to be with his wife, even in spirit, is the best part of his day. After each visit, Caldwell leaves behind a single daisy and penny as a nod to the couple&apos;s favorite songs, &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot; and &quot;Daisy a Day.&quot; <br /><br />This has been Caldwell&apos;s routine for the past two years, until weather got in the way. A few weeks ago, heavy snow blocked the man&apos;s path to the memorial. After slipping and falling last year while trying to walk through the snow to the bench, Caldwell decided to adjust his normal plan. <br /><br /> <br /><br />Instead of walking out, the devoted husband stayed in his car at Lakeside Park and spoke to Betty from there. Caldwell&apos;s change caught the attention of two park employees familiar with the elderly man&apos;s routine. <br /><br />After spotting Caldwell, Jerrod Ebert and Kevin Schultz grabbed shovels and hurried to clear the path up to Betty&apos;s bench. The act brought all three of the men to tears. <br /><br />&quot;We have to make sure he can get to his bench and talk to his wife,&quot; Ebert said. <br /><br />After seeing Caldwell&apos;s emotional reaction to their good deed, the pair of park workers have promised to keep the path clear throughout the entire winter. <br /><br /> <div class="fb-like-article-wrapper"> <div class="fb-like share-button" data-href="http://www.facebook.com/peoplemag" data-layout="button" data-action="like" data-show-faces="false" data-share="false"></div> <strong>Like us on Facebook for more stories like this!</strong> </div></p>]]></description><category>Entertainment</category><source>People</source><channel>Rminutemag1.2365</channel><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Time Inc.

It was a tough job, but <a href="http://www.people.com/people/news/category/0,,personsTax:JaymieDornan,00.html" target="_blank">Jamie Dornan</a> had to do it. <br /><br />To prepare to play Christian Grey in the highly anticipated erotic novel adaptation <a href="http://www.people.com/people/news/category/0,,MediaProductsTax:BookFiftyShadesofGrey,00.html" target="_blank"><em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em></a>, Dornan told <a href="http://glmr.me/1BBIrbO" target="_blank"><em>Glamour</em></a> he had to leave his infant and wife home to visit the dark underbelly of the BDSM world. <br /><br />&quot;For research, one rainy Tuesday evening, I kissed the wife and baby good night and went to watch a dominant-submissive session in a dungeon,&quot; said the Irish actor, 32. <br /><br />The show was run by <em>Fifty Shades</em>&apos; &quot;adviser&quot; on the sexual subculture of bondage, dominance and sadomasochism. But he wasn&apos;t quite the punishing presence Dornan expected: &quot;I watched him do his thing ... It was quite jovial, a very different approach to how I saw Christian being in the Red Room. I think Christian takes it a bit more seriously.&quot; <br /><br /> <br /><br />One thing Dornan himself took seriously was his costar <a href="http://www.people.com/people/news/category/0,,personsTax:DakotaJohnson,00.html" target="_blank">Dakota Johnson</a>&apos;s comfort while filming the infamously racy sex scenes from <a href="http://www.people.com/people/news/category/0,,personsTax:ELJames,00.html" target="_blank">EL James</a>&apos;s novel. <br /><br />&quot;Some of the Red Room stuff <em>was</em> uncomfortable,&quot; he admits. &quot;There were times when Dakota was not wearing much, and I had to do stuff to her that I&apos;d never choose to do to a woman.&quot; <br /><br />Johnson, 25, confirmed, &quot;It&apos;s stressful enough to be tied to a bed naked in a scene.

She even bought the perfect dress during a recent trip to Paris, according to <a href="http://kfor.com/2015/01/28/utah-high-school-student-told-this-dress-was-inappropriate/" target="_blank">KUTV</a>. <br /><br />But as soon as she walked into the event, a school representative told her and four other students to cover up because they were showing too much shoulder and back. <br /><br />&quot;Somehow my shoulders are sexualized,&quot; Gabi told KUTV. &quot;Like it&apos;s my responsibility to make sure the boys&apos; thoughts are not unclean.&quot; <br /><br /> <br /><br />The school&apos;s dress code states: &quot;Formals, backless dresses and/or tops may not extend beyond the bottom of the shoulder blades. Girls&apos; dresses and tops must have a 2&quot; minimum strap on each shoulder. Shawls, boleros and other shrugs are acceptable if worn over the dress at all times. Cleavage covered.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;The dress code has been reviewed and approved by both the PTSA and the school community council,&quot; Principal Rhonda Bromley told <a href="http://www.kutv.com/news/features/top-stories/stories/Lone-Peak-sparks-controversy-after-asking-girl-to-wear-coat-over-dress-at-dance-71495.shtml#.VMk032TF-wH" target="_blank">KUTV</a>. &quot;The dress code is based on the community standard.&quot; <br /><br />But Gabi says her straps did meet the 2-inch requirement. <br /><br />&quot;There were a lot of dresses that were very short, very tight, a lot more exposing or revealing than mine,&quot; she told the station. <br /><br />Her mom, Kristy Kimball, also spoke out about the school&apos;s action. <br /><br />&quot;The message that sends to girls is really troubling and damaging and they&apos;ve already got so many other damaging messages that are being sent to them,&quot; Kimball said. <br /><br />Added Gabi: &quot;Maybe instead of teaching girls that they should cover themselves up, we should be teaching boys that we&apos;re not sex objects that they can look at.&quot; <br /><br /><iframe id="sbg_video_frame" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" frameborder="no" allowfullscreen="yes" src="http://www.kutv.com/template/flashplayers/jwplayer/dev/files/embed.html?video=2015/01/clips/NDYwMWE2ZjkxMGE0&amp;cdn=kutv&amp;adzone=/4756/KUTV/Web/KUTV_News/Top_Stories&amp;autoP=false&amp;poster=http://www.kutv.comhttp://www.kutv.com/template/ugc/kutv/1435/cS0iglqm.JPG&amp;event=iframe player&amp;googleID=UA-11902348-43&amp;parent=http://www.kutv.com"></iframe></p>]]></description><category>Entertainment</category><source>People</source><channel>Rminutemag1.2365</channel><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Time Inc.

And we were right there during Max&apos;s student council speech and stuck by Kristina&apos;s side through cancer. We fought for Julia and Joel&apos;s relationship and cried when Zeek and Camille sold their house. <br /><br />Since the tears are already in full force as we gear up for the <em>Parenthood</em> series finale on Thursday (10 p.m. ET), why not reflect on the most tear-jerking moments?

But their lives, from their very first breaths when they were born 10 years ago, could not be more different. <br /><br />Hailey, a bright, well-spoken child with golden hair to match her sunny demeanor, is healthy, active, curious and artistic. <br /><br />Dark-haired Olivia, known by friends and family as &quot;Livy,&quot; doesn&apos;t speak and cannot feed herself or walk. Her milestones are measured in small increments: the ability to hold her head up for a few extra minutes, or sleeping for a long stretch at night without a seizure. <br /><br />Born with severe epilepsy and cerebral palsy, Livy&apos;s pain is masked by a smile that touches everyone who meets her, says Hailey, the older twin by 70 minutes. <br /><br /><h4>&apos;She&apos;s My Best Friend&apos;</h4>&quot;Her smile is so pure and she&apos;s always happy,&quot; Hailey says. &quot;Livy is my best friend in the whole world. Whenever I&apos;m sad about something, I just go find Livy and give her a hug and she makes me feel better. More than anything, Livy gives people hope.&quot; <br /><br />It&apos;s appropriate, then, that Hope is Livy&apos;s middle name &#8211; and the inspiration for a charity started in 2013 by the Scheinmans. Motivated by their daughters&apos; unique bond and Hailey&apos;s desire to do something to help her sister, Jon and Allison Scheinman started <a href="http://www.livyshope.com/" target="_blank">Livy&apos;s Hope</a> with the goal of raising $1 million for epilepsy research. <br /><br />Thus far, the family&apos;s various causes &#8211; paintings and bracelets made by Hailey, a Livy&apos;s Kids Crew that does projects for people in need and Lemonade for Livy fundraisers &#8211; have brought in more than $32,000. <br /><br />  &quot;Hailey&apos;s example of compassion and love and Livy&apos;s example of courage and grace are truly inspirational,&quot; says Phil Gattone, president and CEO of the <a href="http://www.epilepsy.com/" target="_blank">Epilepsy Foundation</a>. <br /><br />&quot;Hope is a powerful thing when you are trying to change the world. The Scheinman family is changing fear and isolation into hope and inspiration for a community in need.&quot; <br /><br /><h4>Joy and Heartbreak</h4>On the day their twins were born, Jon and Allison were heartbroken and felt lost after watching Livy&apos;s tiny body convulse in seizure after seizure. Hospitalized for nine months, Livy eventually went home with a devastating diagnosis: epilepsy and cerebral palsy caused by a brain malformation. <br /><br /> <img src="http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2015/news/150209/scheinman-1-800.jpg" alt="Twin Sisters Hailey and Olivia Scheinman Inspire Hope for Those with Epilepsy| Heroes Among Us, Good Deeds, Real People Stories, Real Heroes" border="0" height="600" width="800" /> &quot;It was excruciating to see Hailey so full of joy and thriving and Olivia lying there in pain with so many problems and the reality that she might not make it,&quot; says Allison, 40. <br /><br />&quot;It was like night and day, like living two lives. Each of Hailey&apos;s milestones &#8211; her first steps, her first words &#8211; just brought it all home. We cried and cried. It was a tough place to be in, and it was also very hard on our marriage.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Our dream of having healthy kids and doing all the things we thought we&apos;d be doing as a family vanished,&quot; says Jon, 43, an analytics director. <br /><br />&quot;For months at a time, we would lose Livy to seizures and our lives became gray. But over time, we learned to cope. I remember telling Livy, &apos;I promise I&apos;m going to help you. Someday, we&apos;ll do something to make your life better.&apos; &quot; <br /><br /> <div class="youtube"> <object width="320" height="240"> <param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/9bpxi7PFwQs"></param> <param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param> <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/9bpxi7PFwQs" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="320" height="240" /> </object> </div> <br /><br /><h4>A Unique Bond</h4>Jon and Allison found strength in watching the unique bond form between Livy and Hailey. Although the girls have separate bedrooms due to Livy&apos;s unpredictable wakefulness at night, the girls snuggle together at every opportunity, with Hailey reading picture books to her sister, brushing her hair and helping to feed her. <br /><br /> <img src="http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2015/news/150209/scheinman-2-435.jpg" alt="Twin Sisters Hailey and Olivia Scheinman Inspire Hope for Those with Epilepsy| Heroes Among Us, Good Deeds, Real People Stories, Real Heroes" border="0" height="580" width="435" /> &quot;I kiss her probably 40 times a day &#8211; I love her more than anything,&quot; says Hailey, who speaks about her sister at local schools to &quot;let them know that people with disabilities are people just like you.&quot; <br /><br />At age 6, when Hailey, then in kindergarten, heard her parents talking about Livy&apos;s mounting medical bills (she has had two major brain surgeries), she offered to help, painting ladybugs and mermaids to sell on eBay, along with beaded bracelets. <br /><br /> <img src="http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2015/news/150209/scheinman-1-435.jpg" alt="Twin Sisters Hailey and Olivia Scheinman Inspire Hope for Those with Epilepsy| Heroes Among Us, Good Deeds, Real People Stories, Real Heroes" border="0" height="580" width="435" /> &quot;She sees in Livy a sister, a friend and a hero,&quot; says Jon. &quot;Livy is the heart of Livy&apos;s Hope, but so is Hailey. She helped start it and she&apos;s determined to make a difference in lots of kids&apos; lives, not just Livy&apos;s. Together, our girls are showing that there really is hope in the world. Together, each in her own way, they are lifting people&apos;s hearts.&quot; <br /><br /> <img src="http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2015/news/150209/scheinman-3-435.jpg" alt="Twin Sisters Hailey and Olivia Scheinman Inspire Hope for Those with Epilepsy| Heroes Among Us, Good Deeds, Real People Stories, Real Heroes" border="0" height="580" width="435" /> <div class="relatedtext"> <b>More Heroes Among Us:</b> <br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.people.com/article/kalya-losh-kidney-failure-high-school-students">Kayla Losh – And Her Students – Saved Her Husband&apos;s Life</a> <br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.people.com/article/grandma-pulls-disabled-man-fiery-car-wreck">Heroes Among Us: Grandmother Saves Man from Fiery Car Wreck</a></div><br /><br /><em>Know a hero?

Executive producers David Benioff and Dan Weiss went on camera to praise the result of the theater company’s conversion process after seeing their labor of love on the super-sized screen for the first time last week.</p> <p>“I’m still kind of in shock,” Weiss said in the above exclusive clip after watching a private preview screening. “It’s a completely different viewing experience, one that’s so immersive and so superior.”</p> <p>IMAX put two <em>Thrones</em> episodes through its proprietary DMR conversion process for a special screening event that begins Thursday night. Technicians extracted an unprecedented degree of visual and audio detail from the show’s original source material. As Benioff and Weiss point out below, by the time each <em>Thrones</em> episode is complete, they’ve labored over every detail for a year and seen each episode hundreds of times—so it’s not easy to show them any element that they haven’t seen many times before. <span id="more-201682"></span></p> <p>The showrunners also praised the work of their Emmy-nominated composer Ramin Djawadi, whose soundtrack is likewise further detailed by the cinema’s immersive audio presentation. “Ramin’s fingerprints are all over this show,” Benioff said, and Weiss added, “If you have a 25-foot mammoth attacking a 700-foot wall, you better have the music that can shoulder that image.”</p> <p><em>Game of Thrones</em> starts its week-long IMAX run at 10 p.m. on Thursday night. The screening includes two episodes from the fourth season (“The Watchers on the Wall” and the season finale “The Children”). The episodes will be followed by the much-anticipated season five trailer.</p> <p>“The communal experience of being surrounded by other people who are gasping at the same moments is the way it’s really meant to be seen,” Benioff noted. “To feel like you’re there is just something you don’t get while watching on television.”</p> <p><a href="http://insidetv.ew.com/2015/01/27/game-of-thrones-imax-sales/" target="_blank">Pre-sales of the event</a> have been quite strong, with some theaters already selling out some screenings. Fan interest crashed IMAX’s website on three separate occasions. “I know everybody calls <em>Thrones</em> a television show, but it looks like a movie,” said IMAX Entertainment CEO Greg Foster. “It’s unbelievably cinematic. It blew us away.”</p> <p></p> <div style="clear: both;"></div></p>]]></description><author>James Hibberd</author><category>Entertainment</category><source>Entertainment Weekly</source><channel>Rminutemag1.2280</channel><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Entertainment Weekly Inc.

(Ben Cohen/NBC)</enclosure><description fullstory="1"><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Let’s start things out with a group hug, Team Braverman, shall we? But really, now that we’re all covered in sopping heaps of tissues and our eyes are swollen shut after a series finale that made us feel ALL THE FEELINGS, I think it’s imperative. (Let me know if it becomes annoying when I’m still holding onto you in about two weeks, m’kay?)</span></p> <p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Before I begin celebrating the moments that made this final episode of </span><em style="line-height: 1.6em;">Parenthood </em><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">so memorable, I’d like to applaud the writers for accomplishing exactly what everyone involved with this show hoped they’d achieve. Reducing us to weeping, worthless wrecks who will have to take a sick day on Friday? No (although it should totally be excused), to giving this show—this </span><em style="line-height: 1.6em;">family</em><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">—the ending it deserved. Because although we may be crying tears of sadness that the show is over, I, for one, am also overcome with gratitude that we were given the chance to witness the continued lives of the family we’ve felt a part of for six years, and more importantly, that we got to see they were </span><em style="line-height: 1.6em;">okay</em><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">. (Because I’ll be honest, for a heart-stopping moment there toward the end, I wasn’t so sure that’s the direction it was going.) My tears of sadness were mixed with a healthy amount of tears of happiness and gratitude as we said our final goodbye, and for that I’m grateful.</span></p> <p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">I thought about ranking the biggest tearjerker moments from the episode, but seeing as how I started crying at about minute 8 and was ugly crying long before minute 44 (when it turned even uglier), the entire episode was off the charts. So instead, let’s take a look at the poignant way each story line wrapped up. Feel free to grab your box of Kleenex. I’ll wait.</span></p> <p><strong>Joel and Julia</strong><strong>’</strong><strong>s big surprise</strong></p> <p>After getting a call for an emergency meeting with Victor’s social worker, Joel and Julia are understandably worried that Victor’s birth mother might want to reopen the adoption. But the issue isn’t about Victor; it’s about his birth mother. Seems she’s just had a baby girl (not with Victor’s birth father) and wants to give Joel and Julia the first option to adopt her. Before I can even start to shout “THIS IS A TERRIBLE TIME TO ADOPT A BABY,” both Joel and Julia say it for me. They agree that they need to take time to work on <em>them</em> before bringing more disruption to their lives—and the lives of the kids. Yeah, I didn’t believe them, either.</p> <p>In a sweet moment at Sarah’s wedding, Joel tells Julia that he’s been up all night thinking, and realized, “She’s Victor’s sister. She’s already ours.” Is it a mistake to bring a baby into a rocky marriage, and one that still needs a lot of work to fix? Of course. Do I think they made the right decision? Absolutely. Sure, it’s the finale, and I want everyone and everything to end with a “happily ever after” regardless of if it makes sense, but it’s more than that. Even after all they’ve been through, and even after I was ready to show Joel the door (repeatedly) last season, I believe in Joel and Julia, and I believe that everything they’ve been through has led them to a place of strength. Now, let’s just keep our fingers crossed that Sydney doesn’t combust when she realizes she’s no longer the little darling of the Graham household.</p> <p><strong>Hank makes the rounds</strong></p> <p>A couple of episodes ago I designated Hank as the episode MVP, and I’m doing it again. If you’d have told me at the onset of season 6 that the person who’d make me cry the most at the end would be Hank (relatively speaking, of course), I’d have thrown my tissue box at you and called you a <a href="http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view2/4558348/liar-o.gif">liar</a> in my best Valerie voice. But it’s true.</p> <p>Despite it being “basically symbolic,” Hank stops by to ask for Zeek’s blessing for his marriage to Sarah. Zeek initially pulls his famous cocky attitude and gives him a hard time (“What would you like to say, Hank Rizzoli?”) but when Hank tells him about his Asperger’s—which Zeek didn’t know about but admits it “explains a few things”—Zeek lets him know that if Sarah’s okay with it, then he is, too. Opening up to Hank, and explaining not only what Sarah means to him but all that she is as a person, Zeek gives him his blessing, telling him, “Take care of my litt … my daughter,” before his voice breaks with emotion. “It’s gonna be my honor to do that,” Hank responds. “I’m never gonna stop loving her.” Wait, save the Kleenex because you’re going to need them again immediately.</p> <p>Next stop on Hank’s marriage-request agenda? UC Berkeley, where Hank asks Drew to be his best man. “I don’t got a ton of friends. <em>Any</em> friends,” Hank tells him (but he’s working on that). Drew accepts and they awkwardly hug it out. Why the tears, you ask? Because Drew hasn’t had a father figure around in a long time (if ever), and over the past few episodes it’s clear that he’ll now have a truly decent one in Hank. So yeah, I cried. And yeah, Hank has emerged as one of my favorite (honorary) Bravermans. Go figure.</p> <p><strong>NEXT: Everyone</strong><strong>’s employed, and Zeek reveals his favorite</strong></p>]]></description><author>Michelle Newman</author><category>Entertainment</category><source>Entertainment Weekly</source><channel>Rminutemag1.2280</channel><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Entertainment Weekly Inc.

Sure, it’s the finale, and I want everyone and everything to end with a “happily ever after” regardless of if it makes sense, but it’s more than that. Even after all they’ve been through, and even after I was ready to show Joel the door (repeatedly) last season, I believe in Joel and Julia, and I believe that everything they’ve been through has led them to a place of strength.

Opening up to Hank, and explaining not only what Sarah means to him but all that she is as a person, Zeek gives him his blessing, telling him, “Take care of my litt … my daughter,” before his voice breaks with emotion. “It’s gonna be my honor to do that,” Hank responds. “I’m never gonna stop loving her.” Wait, save the Kleenex because you’re going to need them again immediately.</p> <p>Next stop on Hank’s marriage-request agenda?

They were far from perfect and didn&apos;t always see eye to eye, but the love they shared with one another was genuinely beautiful. <br /><br />There wasn&apos;t a school play or family dinner that a Braverman missed. So, of course, everyone had to come together for Hank and Sarah&apos;s wedding on Thursday&apos;s series finale &#8211; even Haddie (Sarah Ramos), who hadn&apos;t been in an episode since coming out to her parents in season 5. <br /><br />Before the wedding, Hank ( <a href="http://www.people.com/people/news/category/0,,personsTax:RayRomano,00.html" target="_blank">Ray Romano</a>) paid a visit to Zeek (Craig T. Nelson) to ask for his daughter&apos;s hand in marriage, not knowing Zeek would die shortly after. <br /><br /> <br /><br />&quot;No one has taught me more about unconditional love,&quot; Zeek told Hank about Sarah ( <a href="http://www.people.com/people/news/category/0,,personsTax:LaurenGraham,00.html" target="_blank">Lauren Graham</a>). &quot;She gives her heart to the people she cares about most. I would just ask you to take care of my daughter. You gotta be there for her.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;It would be my honor to do that,&quot; Hank replied. &quot;I never met anyone like her. I&apos;ll never stop loving her.&quot; <br /><br />The wedding was picture-perfect &#8211; and not just because they had Max (Max Burkholder) as their photographer. <br /><br />At one point Zeek and Camille (Bonnie Bedelia) admired their family together from the sidelines. <br /><br />&quot;We did good,&quot; Camille says. &quot;We sure did,&quot; Zeek responds. <br /><br />A lot of major events went down at the wedding: <br /><br />&#149; Max had his first dance with a girl. <br /><br />&#149; Crosby ( <a href="http://www.people.com/people/news/category/0,,personsTax:DaxShepard,00.html" target="_blank">Dax Shepard</a>) decided to take over the Luncheonette and asked Amber (Mae Whitman) to come back and help him run it. <br /><br />&#149; Not only did Amber get her job back, but Zeek and Camille asked her to come live with them with her new baby. <br /><br />&#149; Julia ( <a href="http://www.people.com/people/news/category/0,,personsTax:ErikaChristensen,00.html" target="_blank">Erika Christensen</a>) and Joel (Sam Jaeger) agreed they were going to adopt Victor&apos;s (Xolo Mariduena) newborn stepsister. &quot;I was up last night thinking: she&apos;s Victor&apos;s sister, she&apos;s already ours,&quot; Joel told Julia. <br /><br />The episode ended bittersweetly, beautifully: <br /><br />After Zeek died in the comfort of his own home, his family scattered his ashes on a baseball field and then played a ball game. <br /><br />We found out that Amber found a new boyfriend (played by <a href="http://www.people.com/people/news/category/0,,personsTax:ScottPorter,00.html" target="_blank">Scott Porter</a> from <em>Friday Night Lights</em>, another project from <em>Parenthood</em> creator Jason Katims). Her ex-boyfriend Ryan (fellow <em>FNL</em> alum Matt Lauria) was still in the picture and helping raise their son Zeek. [ <em>Everyone pulls out their tissues.</em>] <br /><br />Max graduated from Chambers Academy, and Adam ( <a href="http://www.people.com/people/news/category/0,,personsTax:PeterKrause,00.html" target="_blank">Peter Krause</a>) handed him his diploma after taking Kristina ( <a href="http://www.people.com/people/news/category/0,,personsTax:MonicaPotter,00.html" target="_blank">Monica Potter</a>) up on her offer to replace her as principal. <br /><br />All in all, what was so magical about <em>Parenthood</em> was that it wasn&apos;t afraid to bring up subjects that have been constantly analyzed in today&apos;s society, no matter how painful, uncomfortable or personal. The show dealt with cancer, autism, interracial relationships, divorce and adoption and &#8211; in doing so &#8211; taught us that we&apos;re really all just the same on the inside. We are all, in a way, family.</p>]]></description><category>Entertainment</category><source>People</source><channel>Rminutemag1.2365</channel><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Time Inc.

The first sighting was only in 1976, and megamouths continue to be one of the most rarely spotted species of sharks. <br /><br />While this swimmer may look like the stuff of nightmares, the shark is harmless to humans.

Booth&apos;s husband, Thomas, a soldier who was at home when the children were attacked, is not implicated, police say. <br /><br />The gruesome scene came to light early Sunday following a 911 call for medical help to the Booth residence. Responders arrived to find the children suffering life-threatening knife wounds. <br /><br />According to police, Christina acknowledged stabbing the children and told officers she had been having a &quot;really rough time&quot; as a mother, and that her husband &quot;never helps&quot; care for the children, and &quot;gets very annoyed&quot; when they cry. <br /><br />&quot;This was not a blissful household, we learned,&quot; Olympia Police Lt. Jim Costa tells PEOPLE. &quot;There are dynamics between the husband and wife that caused some friction.&quot; <br /><br />But neither spouse has an arrest record, and the household never came to the attention of police, Costa said, until the nightmare events of last weekend. <br /><br />The macabre evening began as a cozy at-home date night for the Booths, who settled in on Saturday to watch a movie and drink wine, according to police. <br /><br />Both husband and wife drank two large glasses of wine, according to police, with Christina becoming inebriated to the point of slurring her words. <br /><br />Toward the end of the movie, Christina got up to put the 2-year-old to bed. The twins began crying, whereupon Christina snapped, according to a probable cause filing. <br /><br />Police say Christina went downstairs to retrieve a kitchen knife from the dishwasher and returned upstairs to slash the oldest child&apos;s throat and then conceal the gravely injured child beneath a blanket. Then, she similarly attacked the twins. <br /><br />Thomas first realized something was amiss, he told police, when he encountered Christina in her underwear, screaming and crying. <br /><br />Thomas soon found the babies bleeding, but did not notice that the toddler was wounded. A Special Forces soldier, Thomas told police he grabbed his medical kit and tried to stave the twins&apos; hemorrhaging, while yelling for Christina to call an ambulance. <br /><br />&quot;My babies won&apos;t calm down,&quot; Christina told a 911 operator. &quot;I&apos;ve breastfed them, I&apos;ve formula fed them, they are not calming down.&quot; Thomas subsequently came on the line to say the children were bleeding. <br /><br /> Emergency medical responders soon whisked the stricken children to a nearby hospital, where all three underwent lifesaving surgery. <br /><br />Christina was arrested and charged with attempted murder, and remains in custody with bail set at $3 million. <br /><br />The children have been placed in protective custody, Costa tells PEOPLE, and will be released into the custody of a licensed foster care provider who is associated with Thomas&apos; military unit at Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma. <br /><br />Thomas Booth could not be reached for comment.</p>]]></description><category>Entertainment</category><source>People</source><channel>Rminutemag1.2365</channel><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Time Inc.

Later in the evening McCord was overheard referring to Fox as her &quot;boyfriend&quot; and the two posed together as well. <br /><br />It&apos;s a fresh start for both. Fox, 45, was married to actress <a href="http://www.people.com/people/vanessa_williams/" target="_blank">Vanessa Williams</a> from 1999 to 2004 and dated actress Eliza Dushku <a href="http://www.people.com/article/eliza-dushku-rick-fox-split-breakup-boston" target="_blank">until last year</a>. <br /><br />McCord, 27, an anti-human trafficking activist who recently went public about the <a href="http://www.people.com/article/annalynne-mccord-rape-helping-sexual-assault-victims" target="_blank">sexual abuse</a> she faced as a teen, reportedly split from boyfriend <a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20747811,00.html" target="_blank">Dominic Purcell</a> last December, after three years of dating.</p>]]></description><category>Entertainment</category><source>People</source><channel>Rminutemag1.2365</channel><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Time Inc.

(Or at least until we start re-watching <em>Parenthood</em> on Netflix.) And in honor of the final hour, which saw Sarah find happiness with Hank, Zeek’s death, and a number of surprising cameos, we spoke with series creator Jason Katims about some of the episode’s most noteworthy moments. </p> <p><strong>On that Scott Porter cameo:</strong> “We had this idea for all these flashforwards in the finale and one idea we had was Amber meeting somebody else,” Katims said. “It was a tough role to cast because I didn’t just want it to be like, ‘Oh we’re casting an actor who we really didn’t know for such an important moment.’ But on the other hand, it was literally  just a moment on screen with no lines so we couldn’t really go out to just anybody to do it. It occurred to me the idea of going to somebody that I knew and had a relationship with. And then I thought of Scott and to me, it was a favor that I was asking him to do this because it was obviously not a tremendous amount of stuff he got to do. I reached out to him and he without hesitation said he would love to do it. I knew that he was also a Parenthood fan and so that was meaningful to me that he wasn’t just walking onto a show that he had no connection to himself. I knew that he really liked the show and that meant a lot and it was great. He came on, he did it. He was fantastic.”</p> <p><strong>On the Amber scene that was cut: “</strong>Actually, in the original version there was another montage piece that we just didn’t have time for in the cut but there’s another beat where the two of them first meet and you see they’re both with their kids at one of those indoor gyms. He’s a single dad and she’s a single mom and the two of them meet and it’s the very first moment of them seeing each other. And we didn’t have time for that unfortunately but I think it still sort of lands.”</p> <p><strong>On why Amber and Ryan didn’t work out: </strong>“ <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">We considered everything because the Ryan and Amber story is one of those stories that was kind of like Hank versus Mark Cyr where everybody was divided on it, including everybody in the writers room. So we had many conversations about where to go with that particular story but when the idea came up of Amber getting pregnant, I was interested in the idea of her doing it on her own. For whatever reason that appealed to me. It might’ve been because it lent itself to stories with the rest of our Braverman family and since I knew we were in our last season, I wanted to see, as much as possible, stories that brought our family together and interconnected them all. So that’s how I wound up there.”</span></p> <p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;"><strong>On losing Zeek:</strong> “I never knew exactly what the ending was going to be. Over the course of the series I’ve wanted to tell the story of losing a family member but I never wanted to do it because I didn’t want to lose any of those great actors, honestly. Even the way we broke the story of Zeek dying kept him in the show until the last possible minute, because I thought the most powerful way to tell that story would be by watching this family deal with this over time, which is how it happens a lot. It’s not just suddenly somebody has a heart attack and immediately passes. I went through this with both of my parents. Sometimes things happen over time and so we wanted to tell the story in that way. So when we knew that this was the final season, I felt like this was our moment to deal with this very intense subject and when we did decide to do it, I felt like that was the story that was the glue of the season, and everybody else’s stories weaved in and out around that.”</span></p> <p><strong>On Joel and Julia’s fourth child:</strong> “ <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">What was in my head was that was a child that they conceived. I’ve heard [of this happening] where a couple is struggling to get pregnant, decide to adopt and then the minute their adoption goes through, the woman learns that she’s pregnant. To me, those flashforwards were about being able to be a fly on the wall a couple of years down the road at these people that we’ve come to feel so close to, at least I know I have, and the other thing that I liked about the symmetry of that is that they now have four children. This has been a show that’s been about a family of four children so I liked the symmetry there.</span></p> <p><strong>On the Seth scene they had to cut: </strong>“W <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">e had a brief scene of John Corbett who played Amber and Drew’s dad. [It was] him coming in and meeting the baby and also finding out that Sarah was getting married and wishing her luck. That was a scene that had to be cut for time, and that was one I regret having to cut because it was a moment that, if you were a fan of the show over the years, John Corbett has done such great work, so it was a shame to have to lose that.” </span></p>]]></description><author>Samantha Highfill</author><category>Entertainment</category><source>Entertainment Weekly</source><channel>Rminutemag1.2280</channel><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Entertainment Weekly Inc.

Whoa. This has been here all along, and I never noticed it,&apos; which is, I think, brilliant.&quot; <br /><br /> <br /><br /> Challenge accepted. But as we obsess over the ABC Family series, Allen is pursuing another one of his many passions: photography. The 25-year-old&apos;s new photo book, <a href="http://us.macmillan.com/static/smp/lifelovebeauty/" target="_blank"><em>life.love.beauty</em></a>, comes out Feb. 5. From taking his first ever picture (of the Los Angeles riots) at the age of 10 to snapping behind-the-scenes shot of his costars, the book chronicles Allen&apos;s creative journey and rise to fame. <br /><br /> &quot;Before I ever began my training as an actor, I was really obsessed with the idea of sharing moments,&quot; he says, &quot;and the best way to share moments &#8211; and I think one of the most compelling means of human communication &#8211; is photography.&quot; <br /><br />  Considering <em>PLL</em> was the <a href="http://www.people.com/article/the-walking-dead-pretty-little-liars-twitter" target="_blank">third most popular show on Twitter</a> for 2014, it&apos;s no surprise that Allen is using social media to promote the project. But even Tumblr queen <a class="celebdb" href="http://www.people.com/people/taylor_swift">Taylor Swift</a> hasn&apos;t gotten <em>this</em> intimate with followers: Keegan is sending Snapchats and even calling people who pre-order <em>life.love.beauty</em>. <br /><br /> &quot;The response has been so incredible, and I&apos;ve gotten to talk to hundreds and hundreds of people, and a lot people have shared their own personal photo journals,&quot; he says. &quot;I don&apos;t look at my fans as fans and followers, I look at them as friends.&quot; <br /><br />As for his day job, Allen kept coy about whether the Liars can trust his character in a town where every cop seems to go crooked (&quot;That&apos;s a question for sure for [showrunner] Marlene King and [executive producer] <a href="http://www.people.com/article/pretty-little-liars-joseph-doughtery-interview" target="_blank">Joseph Doughtery</a>&quot;) but promises plenty of twists and turns. <br /><br /> &quot;So much of the show separates itself from other teen drama out there because [the writers] have knowledge of classic cinema,&quot; he says. &quot;They&apos;re showing the audience all of the cards this season, they&apos;re giving the audience all the secrets.&quot; <br /><br /> And for Tuesday night&apos;s episode, Allen is teasing a big scare. <br /><br />&quot;I do remember shooting a scene and going to our producers like, &apos;You guys are going to really do that, okay, cool, wow ... that&apos;s terrifying, but okay,&apos; &quot; he says. &quot;I was taken aback by how extreme tonight&apos;s episode is.&quot; <br /><br /> <em>Pretty Little Liars</em> airs Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC Family.</p>]]></description><category>Entertainment</category><source>People</source><channel>Rminutemag1.2365</channel><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Time Inc.

He was 81. <br /><br />His half-brother Edward McKuen Habib said McKuen was being treated for pneumonia and had been ill for several weeks, reports the Associated Press. <br /><br />McKuen songs were recorded by everyone from himself to Frank Sinatra and included &quot;Love&apos;s Been Godo to Me,&quot; &quot;If You Go Away,&quot; the Oscar-nominated &quot;Jean&quot; (from the movie <em>The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie</em>), whcih he sang over the closing titles, and &quot;The World I Used to Know.&quot; <br /><br />As was said about McKuen in <a href="http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20104501,00.html" target="_blank">a 1994 PEOPLE profile</a>: <br /><br />He won worldwide acclaim &#8211; and not a little sniping&#226;&#128;&#148;as the bard of middle-of-the-road romance. But fame and riches couldn&apos;t shield poet-songwriter Rod McKuen from a 1982 tailspin into what he calls &quot;a bad case of clinical depression.&quot; It would last a decade. <br /><br /> &quot;I&apos;m not complaining,&quot; said McKuen. &quot;But I would go through periods where I was really down.&quot; It&apos;s not hard to see why. The son of a sawmill foreman who left Rod&apos;s mother before he was born, McKuen was sexually abused by an uncle at age 7 and spent much of his lonely childhood moving from town to town throughout the West. <br /><br />Even at the height of his fame, he was unable to enjoy it. In 1981, the year before he dropped out of public sight, he performed 300 concerts worldwide. &quot;I never saw any of the places,&quot; he recalled. &quot;I would do a sound check, do the concert, go back to the hotel. Then I&apos;d get up early in the morning and leave for the next town. It wasn&apos;t much of a life.&quot; <br /><br />McKuen spent his low-profile years writing and doing film and commercial voiceovers. He never married the mother of his two grown children, who lived in France. He regretted not having spent more time with them, but &quot;I wasn&apos;t willing to give up my work and stay home,&quot; he said. <br /><br />He lived in his old-world Beverly Hills mansion with his brother and manager, Edward, and relied on Prozac to aid in his recovery. &quot;I don&apos;t consider myself cured,&quot; he said in 1994. &quot;But I&apos;m going in the right direction.&quot;</p>]]></description><category>Entertainment</category><source>People</source><channel>Rminutemag1.2365</channel><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Time Inc.

We have the technology. We can make it better than it was. Better, stronger, faster ... and just plain crazy. <br /><br />That&apos;s exactly what Tesla did. The new Model S P85D electric sports car from the company features a dual-motor, which allows the car to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in just 3.2 seconds, according to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/amitchowdhry/2015/01/29/watch-these-amazing-reactions-to-insane-mode-in-the-tesla-model-s-p85d/" target="_blank"><em>Forbes</em></a>. <br /><br />For drivers who have trouble grasping what this acceleration feels like, Tesla equipped their new cars with &quot;Insane Mode.&quot; This terrifying treat is activated by bringing the vehicle to a full stop and switching it to the featured setting. The result is a sudden jolt of speed that will leave you speechless &#8211; or at least with a few choice words. <br /><br />To demonstrate the madness behind the Model S P85D&apos;s &quot;Insane Mode,&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qFV5i8tBhs" target="_blank">YouTube account DragTimes</a> gave a test drive to a few cautious passengers. <br /><br /> <br /><br />Ride the roller coaster for yourself in the clip above.</p>]]></description><category>Entertainment</category><source>People</source><channel>Rminutemag1.2365</channel><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Time Inc.

Maceo Smith New Tech High School in Dallas shows he&apos;s got all the right moves in this hilarious video, in which he dances with his students to Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars&apos;s hit &quot;Uptown Funk.&quot; <br /><br />The video has gone viral, and for good reason. The whole thing was shot in a single take. And they weren&apos;t just goofing around &#8211; it turns out this was a class project. <br /><br />&quot;I heard the song before Christmas and fell in love with it,&quot; Pankey tells the <a href="http://popcultureblog.dallasnews.com/2015/01/video-featuring-a-maceo-smith-student-teacher-doing-the-uptown-funk-goes-viral.html/" target="_blank"><em>Dallas Morning News</em></a>. &quot;We are a project-based school &#226;&#128;&#166; You give the students a project, put them in teams, and they have to come up with solutions. They had three weeks to work on it, then present as a group what they learned.&quot; <br /><br /> <br /><br />But Pankey couldn&apos;t resist putting his own dancing shoes on along with the students. &quot;I told them, &apos;I am not a dancer, but I&apos;d love to do this and go on this journey with you, and we can all learn from it and have a good time,&apos; &quot; he says. <br /><br />A couple hundred thousand YouTube views later, it&apos;s safe to say everyone should be getting good grades on this one. <br /><br />&quot;We had a great time,&quot; says Pankey. &quot;I am overwhelmed by the response. I am honored. It&apos;s all been very positive.&quot; <br /><br /> <div class="fb-like-article-wrapper"> <div class="fb-like share-button" data-href="http://www.facebook.com/peoplemag" data-layout="button" data-action="like" data-show-faces="false" data-share="false"></div> <strong>Like us on Facebook for more stories like this!</strong> </div></p>]]></description><category>Entertainment</category><source>People</source><channel>Rminutemag1.2365</channel><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Time Inc.

But it&apos;s still the kind of steamy drama you watch curled up on your couch with a glass of red wine in one hand and your phone teed up with sassy tweets about <a href="http://www.people.com/people/news/category/0,,personsTax:ScottFoley,00.html" target="_blank">Scott Foley</a>&apos;s abs in the other. <br /><br /> Not this week. From the <a href="http://www.people.com/people/news/category/0,,MediaProductsTax:TVHowToGetAwayWithMurder,00.html" target="_blank"><em>How to Get Away with Murder</em></a>-like time jumps (we see you, <a href="http://www.people.com/article/shonda-rhimes-hit-shows-abc-thursday" target="_blank">Shonda</a>) to the <a href="http://www.people.com/people/news/category/0,,MediaProductsTax:TVHomeland,00.html" target="_blank"><em>Homeland</em></a>-style setting, this wasn&apos;t the <em>Scandal</em> we&apos;ve grown to love. It was something new, something darker and far more sinister than Pope &amp; Associates has ever tried to fix. <br /><br /> Olivia Pope ( <a class="celebdb" href="http://www.people.com/people/kerry_washington">Kerry Washington</a>), the woman who wears the white hat and leads her gladiators into battle &#8211; arguably one of the most powerful people in Washington &#8211; lost control. <br /><br /> Team Fitz or Team Jake? It didn&apos;t matter. Like dream sequence Abby (Darby Stanchfield) said, &quot;There is no man to rescue you. ... You are the only gladiator in the place.&quot; <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h4>Most Scandalous Moments</h4> &#149; Jake (Foley) and Olivia shippers got to see their boozy dance session from just about every angle imaginable, and we&apos;ll never tire of the usually prim and proper Olivia propositioning him for piano sex. <br /><br />&#149; We knew Olivia was kidnapped, but we had no idea she&apos;d been taken to the apartment just across the hall &#8211; and neither did Jake, who chased a decoy car in his tighty whities. (Hey, we&apos;re not complaining!) <br /><br />&#149; Neighbor Lois, we hardly knew ya, but we were still shocked to see Liv&apos;s captors remove their masks just to shoot you at point-blank range. <br /><br />&#149; Olivia woke up in a cell in what appeared to be the Middle East and comforted her fellow captive, Ian. Alas, Ian bore the brunt of her attempt at &quot;fixing&quot; this problem when he was punished (and presumably killed) after she tried to escape through the bunker&apos;s bathroom window. At least she gained a valuable life skill: Fashioning a shiv out of a bra&apos;s underwire. <br /><br />&#149; As Liv dreamed about a better life to keep from going crazy (a technique Jake pioneered), her thoughts turned from Jake rescuing her to a picture-perfect romance with President Fitz ( <a href="http://www.people.com/people/news/category/0,,personsTax:TonyGoldwyn,00.html" target="_blank">Tony Goldwyn</a>) in Vermont: He&apos;s a mayor, she makes jam, it&apos;s everything they&apos;ve ever wanted. But when Abby crashed the subconscious party as the voice of reason, Olivia realized neither might may be what she truly needs. <br /><br />&#149; The biggest scandal of the episode (and likely the entire series) came when Olivia managed to escape by clubbing one kidnapper over the head with a bathroom sink pipe and shooting the other. She ran away in slow motion &#8211; the words of her father, friends and lovers rushing through her head &#8211; and unlocked the red door that should lead to freedom ... only to wind up on a set that rivaled <em>The Truman Show</em>. The building she&apos;d been held in was actually inside a giant warehouse. The glimpses of a Middle Eastern market she&apos;d seen and the sounds of a bazaar? Just a projection screen. And Ian, with his hair slicked back and telltale &quot;I&apos;m the villain&quot; suspenders firmly in place, revealed himself to be the evil mastermind. After their kidnapped buddy vent sessions, he had learned Fitz loves her &#8211; and was going to use it against her. <br /><br /><h4>Best Quotes</h4> &#149; &quot;I&apos;m Olivia Pope ... it&apos;s funny, because it&apos;s useless.&quot; &#8211; <em>Olivia to Ian</em><br /><br />&#149; &quot;Really? Do you even know how to use a dutch oven?&quot; &#8211; <em>Imaginary Abby questioning Liv&apos;s jam-making abilities</em> <br /><br /><h4>Questions for Next Week</h4> &#149; Who is Ian, and, if he didn&apos;t know she was connected to Fitz from the outset, why did he take Olivia? <br /><br /> &#149; How long has Olivia been M.I.A? <br /><br />&#149; Can the Gladiators fix this without their fearless leader? <br /><br /><h4>This Thursday, We&apos;re Team ...</h4> &#149; Olivia. Liv appeared to be truly on her own for once. Besides, we didn&apos;t have enough shirtless screen time to decide whether Fitz or Jake looked more delicious.</p>]]></description><category>Entertainment</category><source>People</source><channel>Rminutemag1.2365</channel><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Time Inc.

In an interview with the <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/utah-killer-influenced-family-suicide-article-1.2096905" target="_blank">Associated Press</a> on Thursday, Dan, who believes himself to be the prophet Elijah, claimed that he and Kristi fell in love and that it was his philosophy that led to the family&apos;s deaths. <br /><br />Dan and Ron were members of a radical polygamous group. Brenda was married to Allen, the youngest Lafferty brother. She was targeted by the older brothers because they believed she influenced Ron&apos;s wife to leave him after refusing to let him take on another wife. The brothers said God told them to kill Brenda and her baby girl. <br /><br />Though Dan <a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/595079489/1984-Lafferty-case-still-haunts.html?pg=all" target="_blank">claimed responsibility</a> for both of the deaths, Ron is currently on death row as he was convicted of killing Brenda and orchestrating the murder plot. <br /><br />The gruesome tale was the subject of the 2003 book <em>Under the Banner of Heaven</em>, a book Dan now says Kristi Strack was obsessed with. <br /><br />According to Dan, Kristi had a dream about him while reading the book 10 years ago and eventually reached out to him. The Stracks became close friends with Dan, visiting him in Utah State Prison on an almost weekly basis. <br /><br />  &quot;He&apos;s very fond of them,&quot; Springville police Cpl. Greg Turnbow told the <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/home/2113605-155/utah-familys-deaths-came-after-obsession" target="_blank"><em>Salt Lake Tribune</em></a>. &quot;He wanted his remains to go to them.&quot; <br /><br />Dan claims Kristi&apos;s husband Benjamin knew Dan and Kristi were in love and didn&apos;t mind. Dan says he cut off his waist-length hair at her request and sent it to the family. <br /><br />But the Stracks&apos;s relationship with Dan came to an abrupt halt in 2008, when the couple pleaded guilty to criminal charges including forgery and drug possession, effectively ending their visitation privileges. <br /><br />Kristi and Dan exchanged letters for a while afterwards, but the correspondence stopped when Kristi said she didn&apos;t believe Dan was the prophet Elijah. <br /><br />Dan told the AP that he hadn&apos;t spoken to the Stracks in years, but said that he believes it was his &quot;hell-on-earth philosophy&quot; that led to the murder-suicides. <br /><br />&quot;My insanity messes with people&apos;s lives,&quot; Lafferty said. &quot;It&apos;s just the way it is.&quot; <br /><br />He added: &quot;I&apos;ll miss them, but I&apos;m happy for them. I believe they&apos;re in paradise now.&quot; <br /><br />Police were initially baffled when the Utah family of five was <a href="http://www.people.com/article/mysterious-death-family-utah" target="_blank">found dead</a> last September. <br /><br />The parents were found with cups of red liquid next to their bodies, while the children &#8211; Benson, 14, Emery, 12, and Zion, 11 &#8211; were discovered lying on and around the bed, covered with blankets up to their necks, with empty bottles of liquid methadone and boxes of cold and flu medication nearby. <br /><br />Police <a href="http://www.people.com/article/utah-family-died-methadone-drugs" target="_blank">concluded</a> Tuesday that Benjamin and Kristi murdered their two youngest children and possibly killed a third with a combination of drugs including methadone.</p>]]></description><category>Entertainment</category><source>People</source><channel>Rminutemag1.2365</channel><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Time Inc.

Martin won't release a new 'Game of Thrones' book this year</title><link>http://www.ew.com/article/2015/01/30/george-rr-martin-wont-release-new-game-thrones-book-this-year</link><enclosure u="http://www.ew.com/sites/default/files/styles/tout_image_612x380/public/1422635989/George-RR-Martin_610.jpg?itok=10-48PIo" t="image/jpeg" author=""/><description fullstory="1"><![CDATA[<p>George R.R. Martin’s long-awaited sixth novel in his A Song of Ice and Fire franchise will <em>not</em> be published this year. </p> <p>That’s <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/30/george-rr-martin-the-winds-of-winter-publication">officially from</a> Martin’s UK publisher, talking to <em>The Guardian</em>. Furthermore, 2016 might not see the book,  <em>The Winds of Winter, </em>published either.  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">“I have no information on likely delivery,” said Jane Johnson at HarperCollins. “These are increasingly complex books and require immense amounts of concentration to write. Fans really ought to appreciate that the length of these monsters is equivalent to two or three novels by other writers.”</span></p> <p>Instead, <span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">HarperCollins</span> will publish a “new illustrated compilation of three official prequel novellas to the series, <em>The Hedge Knight</em>, <em>The Sworn Sword</em> and <em>The Mystery Knight</em>.”</p> <p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">The last book in Martin’s ASOIAF saga, <em>A Dance with Dragons</em>, was published in 2011 and fans have been extremely eager to read the next book – especially since HBO’s series version  <em>Game of Thrones</em> is expected to catch up to most of the  <em>Dragons</em>’ storylines in the upcoming fifth season (the <a href="http://ew.com/article/2015/01/30/‘game-thrones’-season-5-trailer-leaks-things-we-learned">trailer for which just leaked online today</a>). <em>Thrones</em> showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss, who have been told Martin’s long-term narrative plan, have said they want to do two more seasons (and only two) of the show, which still means a couple years of largely paving into virgin story territory and possibly shooting the conclusion to Martin’s saga long before the author’s book-reading fans have any idea how the epic fantasy tale will end. </span></p> <p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">My take: <em>Thrones</em> is a rare instance in pop culture where a story’s books <em>and</em> filmed version are equally exceptional. The first five seasons were largely “spoiled” by the books. That Martin’s remaining stories will be potentially “spoiled” by the show is a seismic reversal in how book-readers experience the story – just not necessarily a bad one. I’m looking forward to eventually watching the show having no idea what will happen next. And ultimately, if Martin’s books will be of higher quality if he takes more time to write them, okay, take more time. </span></p> <p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Of course, it’s always possible that <em>Winds</em> could come out just in time for season 6 in early 2016 … just don’t hold your breath. </span></p>]]></description><author>James Hibberd</author><category>Entertainment</category><source>Entertainment Weekly</source><channel>Rminutemag1.2280</channel><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Entertainment Weekly Inc.

Which, in turn, means that the most talked-about shows inevitably end up being labeled TV’s most successful shows. Think about it: T <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">here’s </span><em style="line-height: 1.6em;">Game of Thrones,</em><span style="line-height: 1.6em;"> with its Red Wedding, Purple Wedding, and continuous stream of unexpected deaths. We have Shonda Rhimes, who’s arguably the queen of the WTF moment with </span><em style="line-height: 1.6em;">Scandal</em><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">, </span><em style="line-height: 1.6em;">Grey’s Anatomy</em><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">, and </span><em style="line-height: 1.6em;">How to Get Away With Murder</em><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">. And then there’s the ever-more-popular </span><em style="line-height: 1.6em;">True Detective</em><span style="line-height: 1.6em;"> format, which is built entirely around solving a mystery—preferably one with a surprising result. Essentially, TV’s best dramas must, on some level, be edge-of-your-seat thrillers.</span></p> <p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">That is, unless they’ve got the Bravermans.</span></p> <p>Heading into <em>Parenthood</em>’s sixth and final season, series creator Jason Katims didn’t hide that the show would deal with losing a loved one. This was never a secret. And by the end of the season’s first episode, beloved patriarch Zeek Braverman had been rushed to the hospital with heart issues. Cut to the second episode, when Zeek’s son Adam asks what he’s supposed to do if his father dies. Zeek’s reply: “If I die, you just take my ashes, you scatter them at center field at Marine Park, and you play a game of baseball over me.”</p> <div itemprop="video" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/VideoObject"> <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="270" seamless="seamless" src="//player.theplatform.com/p/NnzsPC/widget/select/media/dnU83VrGkoRD?carouselID=138911" width="480"></iframe></div> <p>At that moment,  <em>Parenthood</em>’s last scene was basically spelled out for fans—yet many still speculated that, at the last moment, Crosby’s motorcycle accident would result in internal bleeding, and he’d be the one to die. Why? Because we’ve been programmed to expect twists, to never believe what seems obvious. But that train of thought never applied to  <em>Parenthood</em>. The “what” was never what made  <em>Parenthood</em> powerful. On this show, it was the “who,” the “how,” and the “why.” </p> <p>Unlike most dramas on television,  <em>Parenthood</em> focused on normal, day-to-day life. The circumstances were the opposite of extreme—there weren’t affairs with Presidents or kidnappings or mass murders.  <em>Parenthood</em> followed the Bravermans as they dealt with bullying, first love, infidelity, money issues, sibling rivalries, and other issues that likely affected the majority of its viewers. In its most dramatic moments, the worst the Bravermans had to face were car crashes, heart attacks, cancer, PTSD, and Asperger’s Syndrome. It was a very human show, a very relatable show—and a rarity. Which raises a question: When did real life become too boring for television?</p> <p>Obviously, extreme circumstances make for good, juicy TV.  <em>Scandal</em>’s  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id1zIn5_CEA">“bitch baby” speech</a> never would’ve happened without a foundation of murder, prostitution, and blackmail. But as great as that speech was, Zeek telling Amber that  <a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/233852">she can’t mess up his dream</a> is just as powerful—and all it took to get to <em>his</em> speech was a teenager making a poor choice and getting into a car accident.</p> <p>And in  <em>Parenthood</em>’s final hour, which aired Thursday night, the show ended on the exact note fans expected: Zeek’s ashes being spread on a baseball field, followed by the family playing a game. Once again, the show proved that it didn’t need “spoiler alert”-worthy moments to create scenes worthy of conversation. It’s a testament to both the show’s writers and its actors that they could turn any mundane activity into must-watch television.</p> <p>So yes, the ending of  <em>Parenthood</em> was utterly predictable. But that didn’t affect its impact. This show thrived most between plot points—in the glances shared by these incredibly complex characters, in their everyday tasks, in the moments when life slows down. It was about the connection viewers felt to this family. We all wanted to be a Braverman—not because the family’s life seemed overly exciting, but because they nothing but try to be the very best they could be, always supporting one another along the way.</p> <p>That connection fans felt to these characters—and not the action of the show—is why  <em>Parenthood</em> became known as the drama that made you cry each week, whether you were weeping at something as big as a death or something as small as a Braverman dance party. At  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">the end of the day, the action—the doing—didn’t matter, so long as the Bravermans were the ones doing it.</span></p>]]></description><author>Samantha Highfill</author><category>Entertainment</category><source>Entertainment Weekly</source><channel>Rminutemag1.2280</channel><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Entertainment Weekly Inc.

It is early January in Paris, and the actress has invited a journalist over for champagne and a chat. She is, of course, impeccably dressed in an embroidered black velvet gown and gold Chanel ballet flats, a strand of pearls knotted chicly at her chest.</span></p> <p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">The stately town house that has been de Havilland’s home for the past 58 years is undergoing repairs, so she receives her guest in her temporary quarters: a suite in an exclusive hotel that is located, quite fittingly for this grande dame of the silver screen, in a 19th-century château.</span></p> <p>An assistant pours bubbly into two flutes. “What are we toasting?” de Havilland asks, raising her glass.</p> <p>How about the hostess herself?</p> <p>At 98, Olivia de Havilland is the last great star of Hollywood’s golden age, a woman who began her career during the rise of Technicolor in 1935, formed one of the most indelible screen couples of all time with Errol Flynn, and went on to work with James Cagney, Rita Hayworth, Montgomery Clift, Bette Davis, Richard Burton, Clark Gable, and Vivien Leigh. With her deep brown doe eyes and apple-cheeked smile, the two-time Best Actress winner excelled at playing heroines whose demure bearing belied a feisty core. The most famous of these great ladies was Melanie Hamilton, the tenderhearted foil to Leigh’s scheming Scarlett O’Hara in 1939’s <em>Gone With the Wind</em>. Based on Margaret Mitchell’s best-seller, the beloved epic has sold more tickets in its lifetime than any other film. And 75 years ago it cleaned up at the Academy Awards, winning eight of its 13 nominations.</p> <p>Having outlived all of her costars (as well as the movie’s mad-genius producer, David O. Selznick, and the three directors he hired to steer the massive ship), de Havilland has been <em>GWTW</em>’s principal spokesperson for almost five decades, the sole bearer of the Tara torch. It’s a privilege she calls “rather wonderful,” as her affection for the film is genuine and deep. She’s seen <em>GWTW</em> “about 30 times,” she says, and still enjoys watching it for the emotional jolt it brings as she reconnects with those costars—Gable, Leigh, Hattie McDaniel, and Leslie Howard—who have long since passed on.</p> <p>“Luckily, it does not make me melancholy,” she says via email a few days after our meeting. (Though an expert raconteuse, she’s conscientious about facts—”I want to be a font of truth”—and will discuss the finer points of her career only in writing.) “Instead, when I see them vibrantly alive on screen, I experience a kind of reunion with them, a joyful one.”</p> <p>Joy seems to be a dominant emotion in de Havilland’s world—at least this evening. Though her vision and hearing are somewhat limited, her mind is sharp. She is witty, warm, and engaged, her eyes bright as she spins yarn after lively yarn over the course of a three-hour conversation. “How’s this for an histoire?” she says in her deep, rich voice before launching into a tale of a slapstick bedpan mishap during a stay in a French hospital. Her speech is peppered with throwback words like <em>golly</em>, <em>marvelous</em>, and <em>splendid</em>. More than once, she summons her assistant by cupping her hands around her mouth and playfully calling, “Oh, dear giiirl!”</p> <p>Her memory is enviable: She vividly recalls lying in her crib as a baby and hearing the clink-clink of her nanny preparing her bottle. And she is delightfully open about her age. While discussing her day-to-day life at the hotel, for instance, she gets a mischievous twinkle in her eye as she describes the handsome fellows from room service. “How many women in this world are served breakfast in bed every morning by a gorgeous young man? I am,” she says. “So how do I feel about older age? Crazy about it! Wouldn’t trade it for anything!”</p> <p>Even before <em>GWTW</em>, de Havilland was a star. Born to British expats in Japan, she was raised in Saratoga, Calif., and became a contract player at Warner Bros. at age 18. It was there that she met Errol Flynn, the dashing Aussie playboy with whom she shared the screen eight times, most memorably in 1938’s giddy frolic <em>The Adventures of Robin Hood</em>, in which she played a spirited Maid Marian. Their chemistry was instant, yet despite rumors, de Havilland maintains they were never lovers off screen. “Oh, Mr. Flynn, Mr. Flynn, Mr. Flynn! A cantankerous fate kept us together in films and apart in real life,” she writes. “Much as I have sometimes mourned this, if it had been otherwise I would never have played Melanie” and many others. “And who can say that our union would have lasted?” (Even over email, de Havilland is every bit the dowager of theatricality you want her to be.)</p> <p>Fun as the Flynn pictures were, the actress felt confined at Warner Bros., which cast her in one stock love-interest part after another. If she turned a role down, she was suspended. “What bothered me was playing one-dimensional parts in films which were really about ‘Boy Meets Girl,’ ‘Will Boy Get Girl?’ (He always did),” she emails. “Those roles were intended simply to fill the routine function of ‘The Girl.’ Little, if any, character development was involved.” For a woman who herself was so much more than just “The Girl” in real life, she needed more.</p> <p>So when an offer came from Selznick to play a character as fully drawn as Melanie—whose trials include giving birth while Atlanta falls to the Yankees—de Havilland knew it could spring her from her creative prison. “The role was just what I wanted, and just what I needed,” she says. Gentle and sincere, her performance earned de Havilland her first Oscar nomination, for Supporting Actress. But at the ceremony, the name called was Hattie McDaniel, who played Mammy.</p> <p>De Havilland was crushed. “When I returned home on Oscar night, aged 23 and the loser of the award…. I was convinced there was no God,” she says via email. But when she considered the historical significance of McDaniel becoming the first African-American to win, her loss didn’t seem so dramatic. And she cheered herself up by interpreting the Academy’s decision as vindication that she belonged in the lead category all along. “About two weeks later, I woke up and thought, ‘Oh, how wonderful! I wasn’t a supporting actress, and Hattie was, and she won! Those blessed voters were not misled for one minute…. I’d rather live in a world where someone who is a supporting actress wins against someone who, instead, is a star playing a starring role!… There is a God, after all!’ “</p> <p>The real disappointment came back at Warner Bros., which still refused to offer her roles that cracked the superficial ingenue mold. So in 1943, de Havilland fought back. When the studio tried to extend her contract beyond seven years, she sued and won. Her moxie—a quality hardly encouraged in women back then—changed the industry. To this day the law that makes such practices illegal is called the de Havilland Decision. (The honor, she says, feels “absolutely marvelous!”)</p> <p>For her, the ruling meant artistic freedom at last, and she made the most of it by entering into a golden age of her own. In 1947 she won Best Actress for her portrayal of an unwed mother in <em>To Each His Own</em>. In 1949 she was nominated again, for <em>The Snake Pit</em>, in which she starred as a patient in a mental hospital. On a roll, she then closed out the decade with William Wyler’s 1949 masterpiece, <em>The Heiress</em>. For her turn as a naive young woman who falls for a fortune hunter (Montgomery Clift), the Academy rewarded her with a second Best Actress statuette.</p> <p>It was no less a figure than James Stewart, an ex-beau, who handed her the trophy on Oscar night. “Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy!” she writes. “How extraordinary that, almost exactly 10 years after we first met and you escorted me to the New York premiere of <em>Gone With the Wind</em>, it should be you who presented me with that second Oscar and escorted me off stage at the Hollywood Pantages Theatre.”</p> <p>As the hours glide by on this January evening, de Havilland reassures her guest that she is not overstaying her welcome. Gesturing to the champagne flute (which has been refilled numerous times), she says, “You pay attention to the little glass in front of you. When it’s empty, let that be your signal.” And so we keep drinking and talking.</p> <p>When de Havilland moved to France in 1953 to marry her second husband, a Frenchman, she was all too happy to bid adieu to Hollywood, where television had begun to eclipse film. “The Golden Era…was dying and I knew that whatever replaced it would not be its equal,” she writes. So she focused on her children, Benjamin and Gisèle, took the occasional job by “commuting to Hollywood,” as her son once put it, and earned an Emmy nomination in 1987 for her role as a Russian empress in the NBC miniseries <em>Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna</em>. Even after her second divorce in 1979, living abroad afforded her a life of great privacy, which she continues to cherish. Tabloids frothed for years over her relationship with her sister, the actress Joan Fontaine, which was famously strained, at least according to Fontaine, who wrote about it in her 1978 autobiography. De Havilland, however, does not discuss it. ( <a href="http://www.ew.com/article/2013/12/15/joan-fontaine-dies">Fontaine died in 2013</a>.)</p> <p>Though she lives alone, de Havilland is far from lonely. She regularly speaks on the phone with Gisèle, who lives in California. (Benjamin passed away in 1991 from over-radiation following his treatment for cancer.) Depending on her energy level, she entertains about once a week. She is still a dues-paying member of the Academy and follows nomination season “with extreme interest,” but because of her declining eyesight, she no longer watches many films and does not vote. She can still do crossword puzzles, though, and in the coming months she hopes to make progress on the autobiography she began a few years ago. She’s written five chapters in the same buoyant style that she used in her charming 1962 book of essays, <em>Every Frenchman Has One</em>. A lover of words, she is enjoying mining her rich, long life for remembrances.</p> <p>And if she has anything to do with it, she will collect many, many more. Because this formidable woman has every intention of celebrating her 100th birthday come July 1, 2016. “Oh, I can’t wait for it,” she says. “I’m certainly relishing the idea of living a century. Can you imagine that? What an achievement.”</p>]]></description><author>Missy Schwartz</author><category>Entertainment</category><source>Entertainment Weekly</source><channel>Rminutemag1.2280</channel><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Entertainment Weekly Inc.

There, he surprised her by popping the question. 29-year-old Dimitrova jumped for joy &#8211; then lost her balance and fell 65 ft. to her death, <a href="http://periodicodeibiza.es/sucesos/ultimas/2015/01/29/143222/joven-fallecida-cala-tarida-cayo-justo-despues-novio-pidiera-mano.html" target="_blank"><em>Periódico de Ibiza</em></a> reports. <br /><br />Dimitrova initially survived the fall, but then suffered a heart attack from her extensive injuries. She died shortly after paramedics arrived on the scene. <br /><br />Authorities say the shocking incident, which occurred on Tuesday afternoon, is not suspicious. <br /><br />&quot;Everything is pointing towards the death being the result of a tragic freak accident,&quot; a Civil Guard spokesman told the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2931409/Girlfriend-falls-death-jumping-excitement-boyfriend-proposed-cliff-Ibiza.html" target="_blank"><em>Daily Mail</em></a>. <br /><br />A source told the British paper that Dimitrova was visiting her boyfriend at the resort and looking for work on Ibiza.

On Monday, a judge granted Bridges full custody of Cai. <br /><br />&quot;After review of all the evidence, the testimony of the witnesses, the report of the guardian ad litem, and the claims made throughout this entire case, I am gratified that the judge found me to be the most fit and proper parent to have primary physical custody of our beautiful daughter,&quot; Bridges, 37, said in an exclusive statement to PEOPLE. <br /><br />During the ongoing litigation, Fuller asked for an increase in Bridges&apos; child support payments and <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/ludacris-wanted-abortion-say-baby-5059417" target="_blank">made claims</a> about Bridges initially being against the pregnancy. Bridges fought back, saying Fuller&apos;s comments were <a href="http://www.bet.com/news/celebrities/2014/03/06/ludacris-says-he-is-publicly-humiliated-by-custody-battle.html" target="_blank">damaging his reputation</a> and underlining the reasons why he would provide a better environment for Cai. <br /><br />Over the holidays, the <em>Furious 7</em> star <a href="http://stylenews.peoplestylewatch.com/2015/01/07/ludacris-wife-wedding-dress/" target="_blank">married</a> his longtime love Eudoxie Mbouguiyengue.

Bridges is also father to <a href="http://celebritybabies.people.com/2011/12/15/ludacris-daughter-karma-karmas-world-website-launch/" target="_blank">daughter Karma</a>, 13, from a previous relationship.</p>]]></description><category>Entertainment</category><source>People</source><channel>Rminutemag1.2365</channel><copyright>Copyright © 2015 Time Inc.

And during <a href="http://tvrecaps.ew.com/recap/the-bachelor-season-19-episode-4/" target="_blank">last night’s episode</a>, Chris Soules was introduced that very idea for the first time during his run when Britt confronted him about giving Kaitlyn a rose, even after she stripped on a group date. Sadly for Chris, that conversation didn’t exactly go well.</p> <p>Specifically, Jimmy Kimmel conducted a chalkboard breakdown of the speech during his show Monday night, only to prove that at no point did Chris formulate a complete sentence.
